Time permitting, I will also give a quick overview of a multi-sensor platform that we have built at UC Berkeley for acquisition and construction of 3D city models at close range, which we plan to fuse with far-range stereo models.

Inverse reconstruction problems arise routinely in imaging applications. Reconstructing medical images from projection data and deblurring satellite imagery are two classical examples of linear inverse problems that I will discuss in this talk.  Wavelet and multiscale analysis methods have resulted in major advances in image compression and denoising, but are more difficult to apply in inverse problems.  Most wavelet-based approaches to linear inverse problems can be roughly categorized as: (1) linear inverse filtering followed by nonlinear denoising; (2) nonlinear wavelet denoising followed by linear inverse filtering.  Unfortunately, in general neither of these approaches is entirely satisfactory.  The noise is usually most easily modeled in the original observation (e.g., projection data), whereas the image is most naturally modeled in the reconstruction domain.

This talk describes a multiscale framework for image reconstruction that combines the "best of both worlds".  The noise is modeled in the observation domain and the image is represented with wavelets (or analogous multiscale representation) in the reconstruction domain.

Expectation-Maximization algorithms iterate between observation and reconstruction domains to take full advantage of the noise and image structure, respectively.  The theoretical underpinnings of this new approach include "multiscale likelihood factorizations," which generalizes the notion of wavelet analysis to a broad class of noise models (including Poisson), and penalized likelihood estimation methods.  I will describe the theory of multiscale likelihood factorizations, then show how these factorizations can be put to use in inverse imaging problems.  Applications to medical tomography and satellite imaging will be presented.

Given a set of calibrated images, a {\em dense} surface reconstruction is possible by minimizing the error between the observed image and the image rendered from the estimated surface with respect to the surface model parameters.

We then re-estimate the camera parameters as described above, and then re-estimate the surface.  This process is iterated.  Whilst it can not be proven to converge, we have found that around three iterations results in excellent surface and camera parameter estimates.

The treatment of missing data is a common theme in much of the work on communications systems, where the solution is normally called "error concealment". The problem also exists in archived pictures, video and film and in this domain the solution is called "image restoration" or "image reconstruction". In the latter case, missing data is caused by the physical degradation of the film medium e.g. blotches (Dirt and Sparkle) or line scratches, or physical deterioration or manipulation of the photograph (abrasion, creases, folds). Whatever the domain, the task is to automatically detect the locations at which data is missing and then to interpolate convincing image material in these regions.

In recent years, the rise of Digital Television and DVD has put a great demand on the holders of both film and television archives to provide content for these digital media. In order to exploit their 'content' broadcasters and archives need to restore the images to a quality suitable for the consumer. Simultaneously with this is the rise of low bandwidth image communications and the whole aspect of error resilience in the wireless domain. This problem is exacerbated by the heavy image compression needed in such environments. Although, these are quite different systems the fundamental problem of missing data remains.

This talk takes a 'holistic' view of the effect of missing data in different systems e.g. defects in still images, error resilience for video over wireless and artefacts in archived film and video; and shows how basic, underlying ideas can apply to many of these circumstances.

Gauss mixtures have gained popularity in statistics and statistical signal processing applications for a variety of reasons, including their ability to well approximate a large class of interesting densities and the availability of algorithms such as EM for constructing the models based on observed data. In this talk a somewhat different justification and application is described arising from the ``worst case'' role of the Gaussian source in rate-distortion theory [Sakrison, Lapidoth].

The talk will sketch ongoing work on a robust joint approach to modeling, compression code design, and classifier design that draws on ideas from Lloyd clustering, minimum discrimination information density estimation, Gauss mixture models, asymptotic (Bennett/Zador/Gersho) vector quantization approximations, and universal source coding. At this stage there are more conjectures than theorems or supporting results, but preliminary results do point out that Gauss mixture models can play a useful role in coding and signal processing problems for information sources that are not well modeled by Gaussian or simple Gauss mixture densities. The approach also provides a natural extension to image compression and segmentation of the minimimum discrimination interpretation LPC and CELP speech coding.

The eikonal equation has a relevant importance in many applications including optimal control, front propagation, geometrical optics and image processing. It is also a prototype for Hamilton-Jacobi equations H(Du)=0 with convex hamiltonians since it exhibits several pathologies related to the lack of regularity of its solutions and to the existence of multiple a.e. solutions.

Let Delta be the set of eht discretization parameters, we look for an approximate solution w related to the residual. This error estimate is used as refinement indicator. However, we also investigate another possibility wich is strictly related to the Shape-from-Shading (SFS) problem with vertical light source. In this case, we obtain a different a-posteriori error estimate based ont the difference between the original image intensity I and the image intensity I' corresponding to the approximate solution. Finally, we will discuss the results on some numerical tests.

A discrete symmetric random walk  is shown to be equivalent to a  heat equation evolution, and an extension to nonlinear evolutions including Perona-Malik equation is shown to be of utmost importance for analysis. Upon unraveling the limitations as well as the advantages of such an equation, we are able to propose a new approach which is demonstrated to outperform existing approaches, and to lift the longstanding problem of when to stop the evolution. Substantiating and illustrating examples of image enhancement and segmentation are provided.

The problem of segmenting regions of interest from an image (or multiple images in the cases of stereo and motion) is an extremely important one in computer vision, and has been much studied. An well-known difficulty is how region information such as texture, colour and homogeneity can be combined with boundary information such as intensity gradients. In the multiple image case, there is also the question of whether computation of a dense disparity or flow should precede boundary/region identification and correspondence or follow it.

In this talk I will describe a new form of energy functional defined on closed curves in a manifold, whose minimum argument defines a segmented boundary/region. The energy functional can be used to segment regions of interest from both single images and stereo pairs and motion sequences. In the latter cases, a segmented region is found in all images along with the boundary correspondences by using the product space of the image planes.

There is no need to compute a dense disparity or flow. The form of the energy functional means that whenever we are dealing with information from a single image (which includes the individual elements of a stereo pair or image sequence), arbitrary region and boundary information can be unified by transforming region information into equivalent boundary information; thus we can combine the best features of region- and boundary-based approaches.

The energy is also extremely general, allowing the incorporation of large variety of image information. All choices for both single and multiple images can be globally optimised using the same, polynomial-time algorithm, by casting the problem as a minimum ratio cycle problem in the discretised plane. There is also a second polynomial-time algorithm, applicable to smaller class of energies, that is extremely parallelizable. The energy is scale-invariant in many cases, being an energy density on the boundary, thus removing the uncontrolled bias towards small or large regions present in many models.

Statistical signal and image processing have been dominated for a long time with the Gaussian assumption. This is not surprising: firstly, life is easy with the Gaussian distribution, in most cases it leads to linear equations. Secondly, for one after rigour: it is justified with the central limit theorem. However, it escaped from the vision of many in the field that the Gaussian distribution is not the only distribution satisfying the central limit theorem.

In this talk, we will challenge the  "normality" of the Gaussian distribution by demonstrating its shortcomings in modelling impulsive data, and introducing an alternative distribution family namely the alpha-stable distribution.

For this model to be of any interest to us, one should also demonstrate the feasibility of developing computationally attractive new optimal signal processing algorithms for alpha-stable distributions.

Finally,  we demonstrate preliminary results in texture modelling and  mention future directions in image processing and communications which are plenty, interesting and come with a promise of good fun.

Aligning experimental data into a standard coordinate system (SCS) is of great interest to neuroimaging science, and a necessary tool in support of genomics efforts for gene expression. Multimodality imaging, noisy data and transformations are frequent difficulties.  Geometric based alignments carry across-multimodalities, yet have to be well structured to handle the noisy/occluded data.

In this work, we introduce a non-iterative geometric-based method to align 3D brain surfaces into standard coordinate system (SCS), which is based on a novel set of surface landmarks (e.g., planar embilical points, zero torsion points, etc..), which are intrinsic and are computed from the differential geometry of the surface. This is in contrast to existing methods that depend on anatomical landmarks that require expert intervention to locate - a very hard task.

The landmarks are local, and are preserved under affine transformations. To reduce the sensitivity of the landmarks to noise, we use a B-Spline surface representation that smoothed out the surface prior to the computation of the landmarks. The alignment is driven by establishing correspondences between the landmarks after a conformal sorting based on derived absolute invariants (volumes confined between parallelepipeds spanned by sets of the landmark point quadruplets). The method is tested for intra- and inter-brain alignments while entertaining cubic nonlinear transformations.

One of the novel aspects of our work is a new shape representation for rapidly indexing and recognising line-patterns from large databases. The basic idea is to exploit both geometric attributes and structural information to compute a two-dimensional relational pairwise geometric histogram. Shapes are indexed by searching for the line-pattern that maximises the cross-correlation of the normalised histogram bin-contents.

The intermediate level of our hierarchical framework is based on a novel similarity measure for object recognition from large libraries of line-patterns. This operates at a more local image level than the histogram based indexing layer. The measure is derived from a Bayesian consistency criterion and resembles the Hausdorff distance. This consistency criterion has been developed for locating correspondence matches between attributed relational graphs using iterative relaxation operations. Our aim here, is to simplify the consistency measure so that it may be used in a non-iterative manner without the need to compute explicit correspondence matches. This considerably reduces the computational overheads and renders the consistency measure suitable for large-scale object recognition.

A Bayesian graph matching algorithm for data-mining from large structural databases operates as final level of the hierarchy. The matching algorithm uses both edge-consistency and node attribute similarity to determine the a posteriori probability of a query graph for each of the candidate matches in the reduced database generated by the lower levels of the hierarchy. The node feature-vectors are constructed by computing normalised histograms of pairwise geometric attributes. Attribute similarity is assessed by computing the Bhattacharyya distance between the histograms. Recognition is realised by selecting the candidate with the largest a posteriori probability.

For each of the above methodologies a thorough sensitivity study is undertaken for a library of over 2500 lines-patterns containing radar aerial images and a number of other images types. The analysis reveals the robustness of each method on its own as well as within the hierarchical framework. This suggests that there is a degree of complementarity between the approaches.

The approximation takes place in a variational sense, the De Giorgi Gamma-convergence, and extends to this second order model an approximation theorem of the Mumford-Shah functional obtained by Ambrosio and Tortorelli.

Markov random fields are used extensively in image segmentation. In this talk I describe a class of models, the double Markov random field, for images composed of several textures, and how to use the model class for image segmentation. I show that many approaches to Bayesian image segmentation are special cases of this model. From a simulation study, a comparison between these models is made.

One of the most challenging problems in automatic target recognition (ATR) for remote sensing is reliable detection of poorly illuminated objects buried in high clutter backgrounds.  When the clutter statistics are unknown or highly variable, the false alarm rate of classical linear or quadratic detection algorithms, e.g. the adaptive matched filter/detector, cannot be controlled and target detection becomes unreliable. In this talk we will present methods for improving detection performance using the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test and the maximal invariant (MI) test for cases where clutter uncertainty can be described by an orbit induced by group actions on parameter space.  Our focus application will be the difficult "deep hide" problem where the target straddles a boundary between two unknown clutter types.

These processes are controlled in parallel and are themselves organized by the structure which they are evolving through an iterative process. Several results show that most of image processing tasks and a broad class of image analysis problems can be solved in parallel structures by self-organizing methods. Here parallel structure means that different processors run on the same task at the same time. It is found that "parallelism" and "self-organization" usually are coupled: if a process is implemented in a parallel structure, it can be described by using some type of self-organizing in the evolution of the solution.

It is well known that the problem of matching two relational structures can be posed as an equivalent problem of finding a maximal clique in a (derived) association graph. However, it is not clear how to apply this approach to computer vision problems where the graphs are hierarchically organized, i.e., are trees, since maximal cliques are not constrained to preserve the partial order.  Here we provide a solution to the problem of matching two attributed trees by constructing a (weighted) association graph using the graph-theoretic concept of connectivity.  We prove that in the new formulation there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal weight cliques and maximal similarity subtree isomorphisms. This allows us to cast the tree matching problem as an indefinite quadratic program using a recent extension of the so-called Motzkin-Straus theorem. We then use "replicator" equations, a class of dynamical systems developed in evolutionary game theory, to solve it. Such continuous solutions to discrete problems are attractive because they can motivate analog and biological implementations. We illustrate the power of the approach by matching articulated and deformed shapes described by shock trees. An extension of this framework to deal with many-to-one matchings will also be presented.

Complex wavelets can provide both shift invariance and good directional selectivity, with only modest increases in signal redundancy and computation load. However development of a complex wavelet transform (CWT) with perfect reconstruction and good filter characteristics has proved difficult until recently. We now propose the Dual-Tree CWT as a solution to this problem, yielding a transform with attractive properties for a range of signal and image processing applications, including motion estimation, denoising, texture analysis and synthesis, and object segmentation.

The average sampling rate required to guarantee signal reconstruction is lower-bounded, as shown by Landau, by the Lebesgue measure of the spectral support of the signal. In contrast, for signals with sparse but poorly packable spectral support such as a thin annular region in 2-D, the multi-D Nyquist rate required to avoid aliasing can be much higher than this so called minimum rate. This talk a presents a universal sampling and reconstruction scheme that guarantees perfect reconstruction of M-D multiband signals not only at asymptotically the minimum rate, but also without prior knowledge of their spectral support. Only minimal knowledge, of a bounding box of the support and a bound on its occupancy rate (non-zero fraction) is required. The scheme can be applied to both continuous-time sampling and discrete-time down-sampling of multiband signals. We discuss applications to Fourier imaging systems and to image compression by minimally redundant acquisition.

In its classic form, this process presents a STATIC estimation problem, since no temporal axis is involved. A DYNAMIC counterpart process can be defined, where a continuous image sequence is to be restored from a blur, decimation (i.e. loss of resolution), and additive noise. This application could be regarded as a simple extension of the well known image sequence restoration problem. However, from a different perspective, one could suggest solving the dynamic problem by applying a static super-resolution process at each temporal point, fusing all the causal measured images.

In this talk, these two super resolution reconstruction problems will be analyzed. Solutions for them both will be presented, based on simple yet effective models. A solution for the static problem will be constructed first, based on the ML and the MAP estimators.  Based on these solutions, a framework for solving the dynamic problem will be presented as well, suggesting adaptive filtering efficient approximations of the Kalman filter.

Digital cameras use a single CCD to acquire color information in a scene by sampling in three color planes (R, G, B) at each pixel.   The image is subsequently reconstructed by interpolation of available neighborhood information.  The error due to interpolation is strictly a function of the algorithm used.

It is important that attention is paid to the quality of the image reconstruction algorithms.   We discuss a variety of methods namely, bilinear interpolation, kernel density estimation,  spatial prediction using kriging, cokriging, Hierarchical models using EM, and Artificial neural networks. In addition to applications in digital imaging, these methodologies has extensive applications in semiconductor manufacturing, medical diagnostics, and environmental pollution.

One of the problems of remote sensing applications is geometric distortion of digital images with comparing to the map of the corresponding areas. This distortion has a complex structure and relates with the process of measurement and nature conditions. Usually it can be divided in systematic (deterministic) and stochastic (random) parts and as a rule traditional methods of remote sensing image thematic interpretation as areas on the corresponding map with a given projection and scale are ineffective. It needs a special mathematical model and technique for preliminary transformation of such data. The result of the transformation has to be an approximation surface with a given maximal coordinate difference for GCPs on the map and that surface.

We apply the kriging approximation for correction of geometric distortions in digital images. The corresponding mathematical model is proposed and discussed. The complex stochastic part of such model allows us to approximate the transformation more accurate and estimate the errors. Algorithms for evaluation of the model parameters and error of approximation are considered. The results of numerical experiments for simulated and real data main are presented.

Note that you can only include postscript images in latex, and pdf or png images into pdflatex. If you want to convert a unique latex source into both dvi (via latex) and pdf (via pdflatex), the best thing to do is to prepare two versions of your image, say image.ps and image.pdf, and include it with \includegraphics{image}. In this case, latex will chose the postscript version, and pdflatex will chose the pdf version.

There are several packages considered obsolete. For instance, psfig, epsfig, and epsf. There is one standard package graphics, and an extension of it, graphicx. There is no need to include these packages if your class is inriaslides or ra1999, or if you load the package RR.

A Type1 font  is a font defined by quadratic or cubic splines, while a Type3 font is defined by a bitmap. All TeX fonts designed by Knuth are defined by a Metafont program (that uses cubic splines) and converted into a pk file (packed bitmaps). Documents including these fonts will contain Type3 fonts after conversion into PostScript or Pdf.

These are searched in the current directory, and then in the default system directory. The name is texmf.cnf. The defaut configuration file /usr/local/lib/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf shows all the variables used by web2c.

This hows that the metric file are searched  in the current directory, then in the HOMETEXMF directory, then in the texmf.local directory, and in the texmf directory, and finally in the /tmp directory. If !! preceeds a directory name the ls-R file must be created for this directioy (at Inria, the ls-R data base is update every day, a bit after 8pm).

Under /usr/local/lib/texmf, there is a standard latex distribution. All files not on the TeXLive5 are now in /usr/local/lib/texmf.local. There is no need to change the environment variables, since texmf.local is searched by tex, latex, etc, as well as texmf.

The usage of INRIA's computing facilities requires an authorisation in advance. This authorisation is finalised, in most cases, by the opening of an account following the demand of a project/group leader.

Every user is responsible for the usage of the computer resources which occurs either from his account or from equipment made available to him. He must therefore at his own level and with the help of the system adminstrators contribute to the security, and the following areas are evidently are concerned.

Every user must choose secure passwords respecting the the recommendations of the system adminstrators. The passwords must be kept secret and under no condition should they be revealed to anyone, INRIA personnel included.

Every user is responsable for the possibilities for access to information on the INRIA machines, whether he gives access to someone else or whether this access is given from within or from outside INRIA. This holds not only for the user's files but as well for all files to which he has access. In particular, any network services (i.e., ftp, web servers, etc.) requires the authorisation of a system adminstrator and the site's security head.

At an INRIA site, every user must respect the rules for connecting materiel to the internal and external networks, as they are set by the local head of computer facilities. The connections cannot be modified without permission in advance. Note that the rules cover both the hardware (physical connection) and the software (logical connection).

INRIA permits one to connect or dialogue with computer sites around the world, the access to other sites must be done with full respect for the rules of usage of the sites and networks and in the respect of the legislation, for example the law 92-685 of 22 July 1992 relative to computer fraud.

Every person for which information is contained in such a file must be informed of the existance of the file, of its usage, of the existance of usage rights and the modalities for the construction of the file, from the moment the information is collected.

Computing resources at INRIA allow the user numerous opportunities for electronic communication (mail, news, documents accessible via the web, ftp, etc.) The utilisation of these supports for communication must respect certain rules.

Each user must specifically state whether he expresses himself personally or in the name of INRIA. In particular when making public statements he must ensure that he does violate the following two points.

The system administrators designated by the directeurs of the different sites have a duty to assure the working of the networks and the computing resources. They have the right to take the necessary dispositions to assume this task while respecting professionel ethics.

In particular, an administrator can take conservative mesures (stopping an execution, removing access, etc.) to handle functional or security incidents. In these circumstances, he is allowed to compile the necessary information, even by examming private files or various logs (connections, distant access, etc) with an obligation of confidentiality.

From an abstract point of view, a program is nothing but a bunch of program code and program data stored in memory. On decent OSes, the memory as seen by a program is a flat address space. On a typical 32 bit processor, this address space starts at the address zero and ends at the 32bit 4GB boundary. Theorically, the program should be able to access any of the memory locations within this address space.

On a normal x86 Linux system, the program has only access to a fragmented subset of that flat address space which is shown on the right (image courtesy of lwn.net). The text fragment contains the user code, the heap fragment contains the user-allocated memory while the stack fragment contains the user's stack area.

The text fragment is usually itself fragmented in multiple fragments each of which represents one of the shared libraries used by the program. Shared libraries are typically used in modern OSes to avoid copying in memory multiple times the code of the libraries used simultaneously by multiple programs. The library code is loaded only once in physical RAM and is mapped sometimes at different addresses in the virtual address spaces of different user processes.

The code of the library itself must be position-independent (this means that it must not reference absolute addresses and must almost always use relative addressing. This position-independent code is usually called PIC.

How the library or the program are generated such that they correctly handle the PIC case is beyond the scope of that document. For more information on this topic, I do recommend you read Linkers and Loaders by John R.

When the user requests the OS to run a program, the OS is responsible for establishing the memory map described above. On most Linux systems, it then leaves the problem of handling the program-library communication to a user program named the loader. On most linux systems which use the ELF binary format, this loader is implemented by the glibc package. On my system, this loader is located in /lib/ld-2.3.3.so.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH: this environment variable is a colon-separated list of path elements where potential libraries can be found. The loader adds these path elements to its list of directories to search for libraries. nm filename: displays the list of symbols a binary file exports and imports. The items whose type is T are defined within the binary file (which means they do not need to be resolved). The items whose type is U are not defined within the binary analysed which means they will need to be resolved.

A lot of other variables are described in the ld.so manpage (since the ld.so program varies slightly from one system to the other, I suggest you run the command man ld.so to get the manual for your local flavor of the command). A lot of things can also be learned from the objdump, readelf and nm manpages.

In most cases, this complicated resolving process can be debugged with little to no knowledge of the exact way things work. The loader first builds a list of directories it needs to look into to find the libraries on which the binary depends. Then, it uses this ordered list of directories to locate the requested libraries. If one of the libraries is not found in this list of paths, loading is aborted and an obscure error is printed on screen.

Use the echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH command to know how this environment variable is set. The ls -l filename command can be used to tell if filename is setuid or setgid. The following output shows that /usr/bin/consolehelper is a setuid program (note the ..s pattern in the user permission bitfield. You would see ..s in the group permission bitfield if it was setgid.).

The -c switch instructs gcc to stop the compilation process after the assembler stage which means its output will be a binary object file which contains the code generated from the input source as well as a lot of other information.

To understand the exact behavior of the preprocessor and debug preprocessing bugs (i.e., macro bugs), the developer can request from the C compiler an annotated output of the source file after preprocessing.

With gcc, the -E compilation option can be used to instruct the compiler to stop compilation at this point and output the preprocessed file. The format of the preprocessor output is described in the cpp manual. For example, gcc 3.3.2 uses the format described in this webpage.

The preprocessing step can be controlled and influenced by many more parameters. By default, if no parameters are specified, the compiler searches a number of default directories for the headers requested by the user. The exact rules used by gcc are described in the cpp manual. gcc allows the user to add directories to the include search path with the -I switch.

To get an idea of what this output looks like, you can use the -S option to look at the assembly output before the assembler runs. The following C code run through the command gcc -S test.c -o test.S generates the following test.S file.

To debug the generated code, you need to request gcc to generate debugging information and store it in the resulting binary. Typically, this is done with the -g option. However, gcc supports a number of different debugging information formats and experience has shown that the default debugging information format used by the -g switch is not so great. As such, I strongly advise you to use the dwarf2 debugging information format which is supported by all decent debuggers which means you need to specify the -gdwarf-2 switch rather than the -g switch.

All these optimization options can be used with the -march=, -mtune and -mcpu options which control what type of assembly instructions the compiler will use and what exact CPU the compiler will optimize the instruction scheduling for.

If you do not disable the linking step with the -c switch, gcc runs its output assembled data through the link process. gcc itself provides a number of switches to control the behavior of the linker most of which are simple wrappers for switches provided by the linker itself.

For example, gcc -lfoo -L/foo/infinite file1.o file2.o -o the-foo-tester generates a binary named the-foo-tester which links statically against file1.o, file2.o and which links against the library foo located in the directory /foo/infinite. The filename of the library foo is expectec to be libfoo.so or, if it is not found, libfoo.a. If none of these files is found, the link step will fail.

Within INRIA's Croap group, my work regarding software engineering often involved user interfaces. What information and how to present it to the end user. This becomes even more important when the user interacts with a front-end that hides several communicating processes. One must have a coherent view of the current state of the system to present to the user.

The systems we developed are open and extensible, where components can be easily removed, to tailor to a user's specific needs, or changed, to replace an outdated component. This requires having an eye on the software's organization both in terms of project management, reusability and modularity, and in the configuration management and version control of the actual code.

CtCoq, my work centered on the user interface once more, using our message passing techniques bewteen the various processes and within the interface itself.  Here managing the screen real-estate and presenting a coherent state of the multiple proofs under development (with smart undoing) was important.  Once again the collaborative aspect of this team development lead to experiece with bug tracking, unit testing, and exporting of this software.

Within INRIA's Epidaure group, my work revolved around the support for development rather than development itself.  How to reorganise diverging libraries, how to handle multple hardware plateforms, defining a common environment and simple guidelines within the group, and how to export our tools outside the group.

Parasoft Insure++ is an automated runtime application testing tool that detects elusive errors such as memory corruption, memory leaks, memory allocation errors, variable initialization errors, variable definition conflicts, pointer errors, library errors, I/O errors, and logic errors.

Valgrind is a flexible system for debugging and profiling Linux-x86 executables. The system consists of a core, which provides a synthetic x86 CPU in software, and a series of tools, each of which performs some kind of debugging, profiling, or similar task. The architecture is modular, so that new tools can be created easily and without disturbing the existing structure.

To link with the MPICH libraries, add -lfmpich -lmpich to the link line for your Fortran applications, or just -lmpich for C/C++ applications.  You must be logged in to cluster.inria.fr (or nef.inria.fr) and use the "mpirun" command to execute MPI applications.  See the man page for mpirun for more information on how to use this command.

The goal of such a platform is to provide reusable, configurable and extensible components in order to reduce the amount of time spent to develop new semantic web applications and to allow these applications to focus on their domain specificities.

Sewese is an implementation of such a plateform built upon CORESE engine. This framework provides a set of functionalities like generation of interfaces for requests, edition and navigation, and management of the transverse functions of a portal (presentation, internationalization, security, ...). An ontology editor, a generic annotation editor and a basic rule editor are parts of the Sewese platform.

To summarize, the overall scenario is that of regular users just editing wiki pages and tagging them with keywords like they do in other tools. IT managers, editors or administrators check the folksonomy being built, look at the keywords and concepts proposed by the users and may (re)organize them adding new relationships (e.g. subClassOf, seeAlso). The annotations that users entered are not changed, but faceted navigation and search based on semantic queries are improved by these new links.

This manual presents how to use Corese. After a short introduction about what Corese is and what it is used for, the main part describes how to use Corese (how to get the standalone version, how to load ontologies, how to write queries, which functionalities are added, how to write a new function, how to write rules), while the final part is more technical, discussing about how to develop with Corese (it describes the API, how to handle the results, how to manage the property files).

Sewese works with a semantic search engine. While Sewese manages the creation, modification and suppression of ontologies and annotations, it relies on the engine for the management of explicit and implicit relationships (implicit means relationships deduced by applying rules) between these ontologies and annotations. At present, the engine used by Sewese is Corese.

Wikis are social web sites enabling a large number of participants to modify any page or create a new page using their web browser. As they grow, wikis suffer from a number of problems (anarchical structure, large amount of pages, aging navigation paths, etc.). In SweetWiki we investigate the design of a wiki built around a semantic web server i.e. the use of semantic web technologies to support and ease the life cycle of the wikis.

The Ewok-Hub project aims at using semantic web to develop systems that allow (on Internet) the cooperation of different organizations implied in an engineer workflow. The future application will manage several project memories on the capture and the storage of CO2, while using technological watch's results.

Moreover, in this project, Corese is also used in the web service approach to make services composition and to suggest to end-users existing services (or composition of services) that can be used in a given context.

Towards this aim, an interoperable and extensible set of innovative services as well as a set of specific scenarios of use will be designed, implemented and thoroughly validated in CoPs of diverse contexts.

The SevenPro project will develop technologies and tools supporting deep mining of product engineering knowledge from multimedia repositories and enabling semantically enhanced 3D interaction with product knowledge in integrated engineering environments.

It aims at helping an engineer to design new objects by providing a virtual reality viewing of the object designed, informations on each part of the object (suggestions of other objects with same properties can then be done) and information about repetitive design processes.

In addition to the classical Information Retrieval scenario, Corese can be used for its rules, which could define (in combination with the navigation of the user) who the user is (a biologist, a  chemist, a doctor..); it could also be used to realize technological watch (with queries -to the ontology chosen- on parent of a given concept).

KMP is a Semantic Web Service for the Cartography of Competences at Telecom Valley in Sophia Antipolis. The aim of the KMP project is to increase the portfolio of competences at Telecom Valley in Sophia Antipolis by helping actors in expressing their interests and needs in a common space. The solution relies on the specification, design, building and evaluation of an online customizable semantic web application.

To get the standalone version of Corese, go the Corese download web page, agree to the "Free of charge software agreement" by clicking on the "I AGREE" button, after having given your name, e-mail and organization.

Once the application is launched, in the "Input" part, load an ontology by clicking on the "Load ontologies" button and by selecting the ontology (.rdfs file or .owl file) to load. Repeat this for all the ontologies you want to load. Note: it is also possible to load a whole	directory in one time.

"The SPARQL query language consists of the syntax and semantics for asking and answering queries against RDF graphs. SPARQL contains capabilities for querying by triple patterns, conjunctions, disjunctions, and optional patterns. It also supports constraining queries by source RDF graph and extensible value testing. Results of SPARQL queries can be ordered, limited and offset in number, and presented in several different forms."

Corese query language is based on SPARQL, but it offers in addition some original statements among which approximate search that find best matches according to the RDF Schema, aggregation, path patterns...

It is possible to require the specialization of some concepts while approximating others by using type operators. For instance, by using the <=: operator, Corese is able to retrieve persons who are teachers (or a subclass of teacher) and who have written a book (or something close) by processing the following query.

The function similarity computes the similarity between two concepts; the result is a number between 0 (the highest approximation) and 1 (concept types are equal). If one concept subsumes the other, we still compute the similarity between the two concepts.

When using paths, we stop by default at the first query that succeeds, but it is possible to test all paths with the property qualifier all::. This is possible both for oriented and not oriented paths.

The function countItem is used to count the number of values for a variable in a result. In opposition to the function count, countItem counts all values for a variable, and not only the different ones.

Select teams (with their members and ages of their members) where the average age of the members is less than 30 years and the sum of the ages of the members is more than 80 and sort the results on the number of age per team.

The function occurrence do the same thing but only for the property in argument, NOT its subproperties. With the previous example, with the function occurrence, we would have found only 4 occurences of the property e:hasFriend instead of 5.

The Corese engine internally works on conceptual graphs. When matching a query with an annotation, according to their common ontology, both RDF graphs and their schemas are translated in the conceptual graph model. Through this translation, Corese takes advantage of the existing work of the knowledge representation community leading to reasoning capabilities of this language.

While executing the query, syntactic or semantic errors can appear. It is possible to treat them in two ways, hence two methods are proposed to ask the query to Corese: one where exceptions can be catched and a second one where errors are written in the result (if there are errors).

Corese grammar is inspired by SPARQL Grammar, but as mentioned in the part additive functionalities, we have added some other functionalities; moreover, to try to be compliant with the last query language of Corese, we are more flexible with some aspects (for example, it is not mandatory to have a dot between triples).

These documents are online because I strongly believe that 'information must flow' and because most of them I could not have written if other people had not put their own documents online. So it is only fair for me to pay the web back in its own coin and contribute to the virtuous circle of this global memory.

The role of the intern will be to study the dynamic behavior of piecewise-linear (PL) systems used for modeling genetic regulatory networks. He or she continues the work previously done by characterizing the equilibrium points and limit cycles of PL systems as well as their stability. Based on these mathematical results, computational methods for the analysis of genetic regulatory networks will be developed. The methods will be implemented and applied in the study of the networks underlying the global regulation of transcription in the bacteria Escherichia coli and Synechocystis. We will also use methods of hybrid systems theory, and control theory.

Within the Health-e-Child integrated project, the Asclepios team will focus more specifically on bio-mechanical and physiological models of the heart and brain of childrens and their growth. A specific emphasis will be put on building parametric models that explicitly take into account the pathologies, but also on relating them to 3D images, in order to learn their parameter distributions from the databases of clinical cases that will be acquired through the project. These disease-specific and patient-adapted models will be used to support decision support systems.

In this context, the proposed position will consist in leading the research effort of the Asclepios team, with a very strong involvement in at least one of the two main topics (brain or heart). An important interaction with physicians as well as with computer science people involved in the project will be needed.

A Ph.D. in medical image analysis is required, with a special emphasis on registration, statistical atlases or segmentation methods, with some application to brain or cardiac imaging. A good backgroung in applied mathematics and an experience in C and C++ programming would be appreciated. Furthermore, the candidate should have an excellent level in English (written and spoken), and demonstrate good skills for team work.

The contractual activities of the AxIS team have been based for five years on two software developed by the team in Java (Broadway*Tools and CBR*Tools) relating to the design of recommender systems for assistance in the search of information on the Web or in a Web site. Our original approach, called Broadway, is based, also on a similarity of user profiles (if available) and on a similarity of last behaviors of a user group. Moreover these systems have learning and on-line personalization capacities.

Data Mining is a large research area, with a lot of open problems. We propose to consider data mining according to a general approach of "Experience Management from CHI Traces". Our domain involves collective usages of NTIC information systems. By collective usages, we mean the usage issued from communities such as citizens, handicapped persons, tourists, a company's employees, members of a scientific community, etc.

The objectives of proposed researches aim to make some propositions of efficient methods 1) to extract knowledge/experience from large databases (such logs) in order to be used as indexing methods inside an experience management framework; and 2) to update the experience memory. Among planned data mining technics, we aim mainly those extracting classification structures, in particular neural or ascendant hierarchical approaches for classifying user sessions.

The targeted user group will be chosen in the first step in relation with our industrial partners (Usage laboratory, MobIVIP Predit project) or local collectivities or associations (Antibes City, CASA, Travisa). Then a moke up of a recommender system inside an existing web-based information system will be developed in order to validate such propositions. Such a recommender based on reusing user interactions will be developed with CBR*Tools our CBR framework in Java.

The study concerns a new control approach that we are developing and its application to robotic aerial devices capable of taking-off vertically, like VTOL vehicles and X-flyers. With respect to more classical control techniques, based on the controllability property which the acceleration of gravity confers to the system's linear approximation, the approach explicitly utilizes the controllability properties associated with the nonlinear system's dynamics. The existence of so-called transverse periodic functions, which results from these properties, allows, among other things, to define complementary (virtual) control inputs which facilitate the design of feedback control laws for the arbitrarily precise tracking of any (i.e. realizable or non-realizable) reference trajectory in the configuration space. Following this approach, the gravitational field plays the role of a stabilizing ``perturbation'', useful in this respect but non-essential to the fulfilment of the control objectives. In order to better evaluate the interest, as well as the advantages and eventual shortcomings, of this approach in practice, for the class of considered robotic vehicles, complementary analysis, supported during a first stage by simulation studies, are needed.

The scientific objective we consider is to design and develop robotic systems which are able to achieve (semi)autonomous missions in unstructured environments. This ambitious objective needs the solution of many difficult problems in automatics (control) and mathematics (mostly related to modeling and perception problems).

Standard tracking methods that have been developed in the ICARE research group (i.e. the ESM visual tracking algorithm) are designed for planar objects. These methods are not suitable for tracking non-planar objects. The extension of standard algorithm to non-planar objects open several difficult research problems if a 3D model of the objects is unknown. The extension of the ESM visual tracking algorithm to 3D objects can be achieved by approximating the surface (e.g. with a Delaunay triangulation). The work will concern the choice, the extraction and the real-time (i.e. 30 images per second) tracking of natural visual information on a 3D (three dimensional) rigid surface.

The applicant follows a university Master program in its second year, or equivalent. He, or she, has a good background in applied mathematics and computer vision. A basic knowledge of simulation tools such as Matlab is also desirable.

The aim of the Lemme project is to introduce and develop the usage of formal methods to construct safe software.  We particularly address scientific computing software (computer algebra, computer arithmetics) and software for smart cards.  The project develops methods and tools to help in producing correct programs from mathematical descriptions of data, algorithms, programming languages, their properties and the proofs of these properties.

While Java designers put a lot of emphasis security-related issues for mobile code on Internet, recent research has unveiled several flaws in its security  model. Yet Java has quickly become a standard for Internet and (through Java Card) smartcard programming, putting security issues at stake. It is therefore fundamental to develop environments to verify the security of the Java platform and of Java programs.

The main goal of the S-Java action is to provide an environment that integrates both layers and allows to prove security properties for Java programs. One of the main challenges is to device abstraction techniques which allow to construct finite, preferably compact, abstract representations of Java programs and to prove that the abstraction preserves the semantics of the program for the property to be verified.

Specification of security policies: the Lande team has proposed a general setting in which to specify control-flow based security policies. We shall extend this setting to data-flow so as to capture non-interference properties. Second, we hope to develop compositional techniques so as to handle dynamic class loading.

Combination of Coq with model-checkers: several architectures are being envisaged. The first, simplest, alternative is to use the model-checker as an oracle. A second alternative is to translate the trace of the model-checker into Coq proofs. However, this alternative is unlikely to scale-up to real-size programs. A third, better alternative consists of using reflexiom mechanisms; indeed, the Coq team has been developing certified algorithms for Binary Decision Diagrams. Yet another alternative is to develop interactive abstractions in which abstractions are built simulatenously with their proof of correction and the model-checking process.

The framework is designed in such a way that it can be applied to arbitrary concurrent object-oriented programs.  JavaCard with multi-threading will be used as an example instantiation for our framework, as it is a complete, but still manageable programming language.

Development of a specification language for concurrent object-oriented languages, combining existing specification languages for Java, such as JML and ESC/Java, and existing specification languages for concurrent and distributed systems, such as Lotos and E-Lotos.

It can be used to study competition between different species of microorganisms. It can be used to study competition between different phytoplankton culture, etc. Mathematical modeling of the chemostat has been developed mainly using differential equations and several results has been validated experimentally.

Feedback control for a chemostat has been a focus of intensive research. We are interested in stabilize the limiting substrate in a fixed reference value using a feedback control law. Nevertheless, this task is made difficult when the output available have a delay. There are several approaches to solve this problem, mainly the use of Smith's predictor and the modeling of chemostat with differential delay equations (DDE). We will follow this last approach.

I have worked on bandwidth assignment in wireless networks, and particularly interested in the Gathering Problem in which there is a set of radio devices, each one of them with an unique independent piece of information that has to be delivered to a specific node of the network. Since the communication between the nodes is performed by radio transmissions, there are interference constraints that must be satisfied.

This research will study profoundly the problem of redundancy and consistency regarding ontology modification, the influence on the set of dependent components of an ontology (semantic annotations on these resources, annotated resources with ontology and other dependent ontologies), the problem of version management of some ontologies, semantic annotations and the problem related to the cooperative and distributed evolution of ontologies and semantic annotations through multiple human agents and various software.

Presentation : During this thesis, we have proposed a real-time, generic, and operational approach to recognising human posture with one static camera. The approach is fully automatic and independent from the view point of the camera.Human posture recognition from a video sequence is a difficult task. This task is part of the more general problem of video sequence interpretation. The proposed approach takes as input information provided by vision algorithms such as the silhouette of the observed person (a binary image representing the person and the background), or her/his position in the scene.The first contribution is the modeling of a 3D posture avatar. This avatar is composed of a human model (defining the relations between the different body parts), a set of parameters (defining the position of the body parts) and a set of body primitives (defining the visual aspect of the body parts).The second contribution is the proposed hybrid approach to recognise human posture. This approach combines the use of 3D posture avatar and 2D techniques. The 3D avatars are used in the recognition process to acquire a certain independence from the camera view point. The 2D techniques represent the silhouettes of the observed person to provide a real-time processing. The proposed approach is composed of two main parts: the posture detection which recognises the posture of the detected person by using information computed on the studied frame, and the posture temporal filtering which filters the posture by using information about the posture of the person on the previous framesA third contribution is the comparison of different 2D silhouette representations. The comparison is made in terms of computation time and dependence on the silhouette quality. Four representations have been chosen: geometric features, Hu moments, skeletonisation, and the horizontal and vertical projections.A fourth contribution is the characterisation of ambiguous postures. Ambiguities can happen by using only one camera. An ambiguous posture is defined as a posture which has visually similar silhouettes rather an other posture. Synthetic data are generated to evaluate the proposed approach for different point of view. The approach has also been evaluated on real data by proposing a ground truth model adapted to the posture recognition purpose.A fifth contribution has been proposed by applying the results of the recognition to human action detection. A method based on a finite state machine has been proposed to recognise self-action (action where only one person acts). Each state of the machine is composed of one or several postures. This method has been successfully applied to detect falling and walking actions.The human posture recognition approach gives good results. However, the approach has some limitation. The main limitation, is that we are limited in terms of postures of interest for computation time and discrimination reasons. The second limitation is the computation time of the 3D posture avatar generation. By using information about the movement of the observed person in the scene, the approach is able to treat 5-6 frames by second. Some improvement can be done to solve these limitations. In particular, the set of interest postures can be adapted automatically at each frame by considering the previously recognised postures to decrease the number of 3D posture silhouette to extract.

Presentation : Program verification techniques based on programming logics and verification condition generators provide a powerful means to reason about programs. Whereas these techniques have very often been employed in the context of high-level languages in order to benefit from their structural nature, it is often required, especially in the context of mobile code, to prove the correctness of compiled programs. Thus it is highly desirable to have a means of bringing the benefits of source code verification to code consumers.We propose a mechanism that allows to transfer evidence from source programs to compiled programs. It builds upon a specification languagefor bytecode, a verification condition generator that operates on annotated programs, and a compiler that transforms source annotationsinto bytecode annotations. We show that the verification condition generator is sound, and that the proof obligations at source andbytecode level nearly coincide. We illustrate the benefits of ourframework in two case studies.

Presentation : I will explain how a maxflow formulation can optimally minimize submodular energy functions of binary variables. Then I will review the existing algorithms for Graph Cuts in Vision (Graph Cuts, Banded Graph Cuts, ...) and show their pluses and minuses. Finally I will show an interesting application to Motion Layers Segmentation: segmenting both visible and hidden layers.

Presentation : The purpose of this meeting point is to present the new technologies for the development of agriculture and food in southern countries. Registrations can be made from January 2007 for the first edition of this international forum which will be held on 6 March 2007 during the International Exhibition of Agriculture in Paris.

INRIA's collaboration with the U.S. dates back to the creation of the Institute and is very well developed given the prominent position of this country in the IT area. Frequent visits (50% of all international destinations outside Europe) take place each year to participate in conferences or work on joint projects.

The presence of French researchers in American academia and industry is an asset for IT research. Participation in industry projects is also essential for keeping abreast of technological developments and for launching start-ups. The development of joint projects, especially under the auspices of the European Commission or the National Science Foundation, should be encouraged.

The creation of technology startups is one of the privileged means to ensure research results and innovation transfer to an industrial partner that will implement and commercialize the resulting product. Since 1984, more than 80 companies have been created by INRIA of which more than ten directly from the Sophia Antipolis research unit.

The forward electro-encephalography (EEG) problem involves finding a potential V from the Poisson equation $\nabla\cdot(\sigma\nabla V)=f$, in which f represents electrical sources in the brain, and sigma the conductivity of the head tissues. In the piecewise constant conductivity head model, this can be accomplished by the Boundary Element Method (BEM) using a suitable integral formulation. Most previous work is based on the same integral formulation, based on a double-layer potential. In this article we detail several alternative possibilities. We present a dual approach which involves a single-layer potential. Finally, we propose a symmetric formulation, which combines single and double-layer potentials, and which is new to the field of EEG, although it has been applied to other problems in electromagnetism. The three methods have been evaluated numerically using a semi-realistic geometry with known analytical solution, and the symmetric method achieves a significantly higher accuracy.

During the last few years, many efforts have been done in integrating different informations in a variational framework to segment images. Recent works on curve propagation were able to incorporate stochastic informations [14,10] and prior knowledge on shapes [3,11]. The information inserted in these studies is most of the time extracted offline. Meanwhile, other approaches have proposed to extract region information during the segmentation process itself [2,4,13]. Following these new approaches and extending the work in [10] to vector-valued images, we propose in this paper an entirely variational framework to approach the segmentation problem. Both, the image partition and the statistical parameters for each region are unkown. After a brief reminder on recent segmenting methods, we will present a variational formulation obtained from a bayesian model. After that, we will show two different differentiations driving to the same evolution equations. Detailed studies on gray and color images of the 2-phase case will follow. And we will finish on an application to tracking which shows benefits of our dynamical framework.

Here, we propose a new vector image restoration PDE which removes the noise and enhances blurred vector contours, thanks to a vector generalisation of scalar $\Phi$-function diffusions and shock filters.

We pursue two main objectives; the first is to propose a complete framework for texture analysis and modeling that combines existing approaches in this domain and provides a reliable texture description model with a limited set of parameters. This model must be general to describe a wide variety of texture patterns. The second objective is to unify boundary-based and region-based segmentation using a variational approach.

A novel variational method that unify boundary and region-based segmentation modules under the Geodesic Active Region framework is presented.  A statistical analysis over the observed density function using a mixture of Gaussian elements, is first used to indicate the number of the different regions and their intensity properties. Then, the boundary information is determined using a probabilistic edge detector, while the region information is given directly from the observed image using the conditional probability density functions of the mixture model. The defined objective function is minimized using a gradient-descent method implemented through the use of the level-set method.  The changes of topology of the curves during their evolution are naturally handled thanks to the level set implementation, while a coupled multi-phase propagation is adopted that increases the robustness and the convergence rate by introducing a coupled system of equations for the different level set functions.

In this work, we propose a new framework for tracking multiple non-rigid moving objects using a region/boundary-based curve propagation model.The objective of this work is to provide a complete tracking model that can deal successfully with the most difficult tracking cases, i.e non-rigid objects and non-rigid movements.

We propose an energy based method to estimate a dense disparity map between 3 images while preserving its discontinuities accordingly to the image boundaries that may be present. We first derive a simplified expression for the disparity that allows us to easily estimate it from a stereo pair of images. Dicsontinuities are preserved using a regularization constraint term based on the Nagel and Enkelmann operator to better estimate and preserve the discontinuities. We assume that the epipolar geometry is known, and we include this information in the energy model.  We derive the associated Euler-Lagrange equation and we approach the solution of the underlying partial differential equation using a gradient descent method. In order to reduce the risk to be trapped within some irrelevant local minima, we use a focusing strategy based on a linear Gaussian scale space.

We present a variational approach to dense stereo reconstruction which combines powerful tools such as regularization and multi-scale processing to estimate directly depth from a number of stereo images, while preserving depth discontinuities. The problem is set as a regularization and minimization of a non quadratic functional.

In this work, we provide a totally new approach to deal with the important problem of matching 2D curves from a stereo pair of images We use the framework of energy minimization and express our problem as a geodesic active contour  based approach.

This paper deals with a fundamental problem in motion and stereo analysis, namely that of determining the camera intrinsic calibration parameters. Two methods are proposed that follows the autocalibration paradigm, according to which calibration is achieved not with the aid of a calibration pattern but by observing a number of image features in a set of successive images. The two proposed methods relie upon the Singular Value Decomposition of the fundamental matrix, which leads to a particularly simple form of the Kruppa equations.

Experimental results from extensive simulations and several image sequences, taking into account the uncertainty of the measurements, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in accurately estimating the intrinsic calibration matrices. It is also shown that the computed intrinsic calibration matrices are sufficient for recovering 3D measurement, 3 motion and 3D Recosntruction  from uncalibrated images.

Edges, corners and vertices are strong and useful features in computer vision. The work illustreted here deals with the development of an efficient model based approach in order to detect and characterize precisely these important features. The key of our approach is first to propose some efficient models associated to each of these features and second to efficiently extract and characterize these features directly from the image.

This work deals with the development of a parametric model based method to locate and characterize precisely important curved features such as ellipses and B-splines based curves. The method uses all the grey level information of the pixels contained within a window around the feature of interest and produces the complete parametric model that best approximates in a mean-square sense the observed grey level image intensities within the working area.

Imaging and HARDI processing methods to infer the white-matter wiring of the brain.  The aim is to understand functional coupling between certain cortical regions as well as the connectivity properties of cerebral tissues.  I obtained a Masters under the supervision of K. Siddiqi  at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.

The objective of this thesis is to incorporate diverse cues in image segmentation using a variational framework. Different informations will be considered : color, texture and/or other prior informations. Our approach will use the curve propagation theory, following the work of N. Paragios on Geodesic Active Regions.

This work will have many practical applications and it should afford an active participation in the developpement and the experimentation of new algorithms in the national project Priamm : Rotoscoto and in the european project Cogvisys.

His research interests are calculus of variations, nonlinear partial differential equations and numerical analysis as applied to image processing. He is the co-author of a book published by Springer in 2002 (second edition in 2006) which present the variety of image analysis applications and the precise mathematics involved.

PDE-based methods in image processing have been intensively developed in image analysis since the 1990s. One of the main interests in using PDEs is that the theory behind the concept is well-established.

We present a novel approach to the cerebral white matter connectivity mapping from diffusion tensor MRI. DTI is the unique non-invasive technique capable of probing and quantifying the anisotropic diffusion of water molecules in biological tissues. We address the problem of consistent neural fibers reconstruction. Our method relies on a global modelization of the acquired MRI volume as a Riemannian manifold.

We study the anatomical connectivity network in the human low-level visual cortex using in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques. 8 different visual areas were functionally mapped in each hemisphere of 4 subjects, and the white matter fibers network among them was then investigated using DTI. Various intra and inter-hemispheric connections were found, globally supporting the ventral/dorsal streams segregation.

We address the problem of the segmentation of cerebral white matter structures from diffusion tensor images. Our approach is grounded on the differential geometrical properties of the space of multivariate normal distributions. We introduce a variational formulation, in the level set framework, to estimate the optimal segmentation according to the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the tensors within each partition.

We have characterized the space of multivariate normal distributions as a 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold endowed with a metric expressed in terms of the Fisher information matrix. Applications under current investigation deal with the estimation and segmentation of Diffusion Tensor Images as well as their geometrical and statistical analysis. We have also proposed algorithms to generate normally distributed random diffusion tensors and use tensors geodesic interpolation in the context of streamline fiber tracking.

This paper is about optical flow estimation from structure tensor field analysis of a sequence seen as a spatio-temporal volume. It tackles two issues.  The first is to review related recent techniques showing their relations. We essentially discuss the stages of flow extraction from structure tensor fields and the obtention of regularized tensor fields.  The second is to propose a nonlinear approach controlled by the intuitive corner measure. The overall approaches will be compared in details on serveral test sequences.

Abstract / The purpose of this work is to develop a new method for collision detection between polygonal deformable objects using graphics hardware acceleration. The approach relies on the OpenGL selection mode which can efficiently be used to find out which objects, or geometrical primitives, are drawn inside a specified region of the scene, the Viewing Volume.

We achieve a significant reduction in the processing time by using an optimized data structure based on AABB trees. We only use a limited set of bounding volumes, which is much smaller than the object's number of polygons.

Medical or industrial data, with the development of modern scanning and imaging techniques such as computed tomography, become very often three dimensional. Numerous example are available like classic, functional or diffusion MRI, positron emission or X-ray tomography, 3D echography ...etc The issue we are dealing with in this project is to define some filtering methods able to analyze the objects that are present in those 3D data sets without introducing any spurious information and with minimal modification of the topology of the shapes of interest. Implementation of the schemes associated to Mean Curvature Motion and best causal affine invariant morphological 3D Scale Space is provided.

The problem of recovering 3D shape of objects is a classic and fundamental issue in computer vision. The main motivation to further investigate this area is certainly our need to better understand the mechanisms by which the human visual system actually uses shading information to recover shapes. In this project, we focus our attention on reflectance based methods from one (Shape from Shading) and several (Photometric Stereo) irradiance images. Implementation of various algorithms in C++ and OpenGL is provided.

Content base image retrieval is a rapidly growing research area aiming to provide fast and robust algorithms to search and browse large databases of images, and textures in particular, by the only means of their visual appearance. No textual description of the images content is supposed to be available. We review in this report some well known methods to tackle this task. Implementations of approaches based on the histogram or on the distribution of the wavelet coefficients are provided.

The idea is to use the information provided by different views of a scene to estimate the instrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera(s) and thus to allow measurements in the observed scene. This involves the computation of the fundamental matrix, and numerous methods have been proposed to solve this problem, as well as the use of the Kruppa equations for the estimation of the camera(s) parameters.

Grassmann-Cayley algebra provides us with a unique, elegant and flexible framework to deal algebraically with the notions of duality and incidence of vector and projective subspaces. A small application to the modeling of the geometry of one view is presented.

Magneto-electroencephalography (MEEG) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique which offers excellent time-resolution (of order 1 ms), but  its spatial resolution,  currently of the order of 10~mm in industrial systems, is not as small as the one achieved by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (about 1 mm). Much research effort is being devoted to improving the spatial resolution of MEEG, both by better  biological modelling, and by developping numerical methods for the direct and inverse problems.

Abstract:  Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) are two non-invasive techniques which are sensitive to cortical electrophysiological activity. Characterization and imaging of their generators may contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of neural activations across the cortex in the millisecond time range.

Though the corresponding inverse problem is ill-posed, reasonable a priori modeling of basic properties of the expected neural source assemblies can be introduced as regularization features of the source estimation process.

We will introduce some of the basic forward and inverse approaches used in the MEG/EEG imaging community and illustrate the techniques with examples of experimental protocols from cognitive neurophychology and clinical research in epilepsy.

Abstract:    This talk addresses the "direct EEG problem": the calculation of the electric potential on the scalp for a known configuration of  sources, assuming piecewise constant tissue conductivities.  The potential is the solution of a Poisson equation, which, under a piecewise constant head conductivity model, can be solved using a Boundary Element Method. All previous Boundary Element solutions to this problem have used the same integral formulation, based on a double layer potential. In this talk we  introduce a new symmetric formulation which combines single and double layer potentials. Numerical experiments show that our new Boundary Element solution is significantly more accurate than the  classical  Boundary Element results reported in the litterature.

Abstract:  We discuss in this talk the mathematical problem of identifying the primary sources in the brain from the measurements of the electric field at the surface of the head (EEG) or the magnetic field around the head (MEG).

We assume that the head is made up of disjoint coated domains (scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid and  brain), in each of which the conductivity is constant, and that the support of the cerebral current is in the innermost one (the cortex).

Otherwise the geometry of these domains can be arbitrary. We show that, in general, these exterior measurements do not permit to determine uniquely distributed currents. However, for mono or dipole sources, this uniqueness is true, and in this case, we give an algorithm to determine the number, locations and moments of the dipoles.

This provides the basis of a constructive test to establish the presence of sources in the domain (brain) and to to localize them, as singularities (analyticity defaults) of some function of the complex variable.

When I'm not working, I like to see movies (especially old ones), do some sport (but just enough for fun without having the tedium of doing too much training), or occasionnally to have a walk in the mountains where ever I am.  When I have the time, I like to read (and when there is no time, I watch TV :-().

Mostly, I read novels of any sort (though I do not like biographies very much). Often I read SF, fantasy or thriller books as well as the more classic novels (and I usually do mix the types of books I'm reading).

I also had some interest in autocalibration, projective invariance, derivative computation and edge extraction. I have been looking into uncalibrated motion analysis and more particularly into ways of finding both the camera parameters and the motion from geometric features extracted from image sequences.

My interests also involve Computer Algebra (and more specifically Maple ). I have also written a number of useful packages for vision related work and also some more general ones for maintaning maple sources and for generating C functions. I have also realized a C library to call maple from C programs: this has proved for example to be a very useful tools when trying to plot mathematical objects. Send me an E-Mail if you want more information about this.

My research program is based on the assumption that for biological or artificial systems,  the capabilities and performances of perceptual mechanisms are improved by the use of parameteric adaptive mechanisms.

Recent work, beyond classical biological models of neuronal networks, consider biologically plausible multi-model estimation methods and also trajectory generation in addition to low-dimensional classifiers and cortical areas calculations in relation with the INRIA cortex project-team and the INCM dyva group.

Control mechanism providing instantaneous adaptation to the local level of contrast. This stage is modelled as a dynamic shunting feedback by amacrine cells onto bipolar cells; the resulting model reproduces contrast-dependent amplitude and phase non-linearities, as measured in real mammalian retinas by Shapley & Victor 78.

Spike generation by one or several layers of ganglion cells paving the visual field. Magnocellular and Parvocellular pathways can be modelled in the same framework according to the parameters chosen. Large-scale simulations can be pursued on up to 50,000 spiking cells.

Possibility of a global radial inhomogeneity modeling the foveated organisation of mammalian retinas. In this case, the spatial scales of filtering, and the density of spiking cells, both depend on the eccentricity from the center of the retina.

The duality between  k-simplex meshes  and   k-triangulations  is shown below: dashed lines correspond to   k-simplex meshes  and solid lines to   k-triangulations . Thus a vertex of a 2-simplex mesh is associated by duality to a triangle and an edge of a 2-simplex mesh to a edge of the triangulation. Note that a 1-simplex mesh and 1-triangulation are basically the same thing : a polygonal line.

Given a finite set of points P in Rd, the diameter of P is defined as the maximum distance between two points of P. We propose a very simple algorithm to compute the diameter of a finite set of points.  Although the algorithm is not worst-case optimal, it appears to be extremely fast for a large variety of point distributions.

In binary images, object's points are characterized by some non-zero value (typically 1 or 255), while background's points have a null value. Topological numbers in binary images depend on the number of connected components in small neighborhood around the point.

First, I have registered both data sets to obtain one single 3D data volume, which is my head (still without the ears). For that task, I apply an original method of potential minimization (used to match multimodal medical images).

The segmentation of the head is quite easy. By a single thresholding, one can really easily remove the background in MR images. Some little connected components may remain (after thresholding) in the background, but they can be removed by considering only the greatest connected component in the thresholded image.

The edge detection is performed in 2D on each sagittal slice, and the results are collected to form a 3D volume. Edges are superimposed on the original 3D MR data volume. One may notice that the collection of 2D edges is not coherent along the third dimension.

Although it has be designed for edge detection (and thus performs smoothing and first order derivatives), the filtering part of the code can be used to compute image derivatives up to the second order (e.g. curvatures).

The 3D reconstruction is computed from a 3D CT scan image. You may see part of the skull, the two eyes, the two lens, the left optical nerve (in red), the clips (in yellow) and the projection of the retinography into the right eye.

The principle of resampling is then to compute, for each point (of integer coordinates) in the result image its correspondant (of real coordinates) in the original image, and to estimate the grey level value of the correspondant. Thus, the transformation from the original image into the result image is the inverse of the given matrix.

Once the computation ends, the results are again displayed in a more concise table (using the -latex option, i.e. by specifying  -latex filename in the command line, it can also be written in LaTeX format).

Each time a for command is executed, identifier is set to the next word taken from the in word list.  If in word ...  is omitted, the for com- mand executes the do list once for each positional parameter that is set.  (See Parameter Substitution.)  Execution ends when there are no more words in the list.

Executes the while list repeatedly, and if the exit status of the last command in the list is 0 (zero), executes the do list; otherwise the loop terminates.  If no commands in the do list are executed, then the while command returns a 0 (zero) exit status; The keyword until can be used in place of while to negate the loop termination test.

Executes the list following if and, if it returns a 0 (zero) exit status, executes the list following the first then.  Otherwise, the list following elif is executed and, if its value is 0 (zero), the list following the next then is executed.  Failing that, the else list is executed.  If no else list or then list is executed, then the if com- mand returns a 0 (zero) exit status.

Executes the single command (including its arguments) if the specified expression evaluates TRUE.  Variable substitution on command happens early, at the same time it does for the rest of the if command.  The command argument must be a simple command (rather than a pipeline, com- mand list, alias, or parenthesized command list).  Note that input/output redirection occurs even if expression is FALSE and command is not executed.

In the preceding list, operators of equal precedence appear on the same line, below those lines containing operators (if any) that have greater precedence, and above those lines containing operators having lesser pre- cedence.  The ==, !=, =~, and !~ operators compare their arguments as strings; all others operate on numbers.  The =~ and !~ operators are simi- lar to != and ==, except that the rightmost side is a pattern against which the left-hand operand is matched.  This reduces the need for use of the switch statement in shell scripts when all that is really needed is pattern matching.

Null or missing arguments are considered 0 (zero).  The result of all expressions are strings, which represent decimal numbers.  It is important to note that no two components of an expression can appear in the same word.  Except when next to components of expressions that are syntactically significant to the parser (&, |, <, >, -, (, and ) ) expression components should be surrounded with spaces.

If  the shell variable noclobber is set, then the file must not exist or be a char acter special file (e.g. a terminal or `/dev/null')  or  an  error  results.   This helps  prevent  accidental destruction of files.  In this case the `!' forms can be used to suppress this check.

A command receives the environment in which the shell was invoked as modified by the input- output  parameters and the presence of the command in a pipeline.  Thus, unlike some previ ous shells, commands run from a file of shell commands have no access to the  text  of  the commands  by  default;  rather  they receive the original standard input of the shell.  The `<<' mechanism should be used to present inline data.  This permits shell  command  scripts to  function as components of pipelines and allows the shell to block read its input.  Note that the default standard input for a command run detached is not the empty file /dev/null, but  the  original  standard  input of the shell.  If this is a terminal and if the process attempts to read from the terminal, then the process will block and the user will be  noti fied (see Jobs).

Compares expression1 with expression2, which must be a regular expres- sion, with syntax as described for grep, except that all patterns are anchored, so ^ (circumflex) (which anchors a pattern to the beginning of a line) is not a special character in this context.

This searches the entire file system and writes the complete path names of all files named .profile.  The / (backslash) tells find to search the root directory and all of its subdirectories.  This may take a while, so it is best to limit the search by specifying the directories where you think the files might be.

This lists the names of the files that have only owner-read and owner-write permission.  The . (dot) tells find to search the current directory and its subdirectories.  See the chmod(1) reference page for details about permission codes.

This lists the names of the ordinary files (-type f) that have more than one link (-links +1).  Note that every directory has at least two links:  the entry in its parent directory and its own . (dot) entry.

The interpretation of neurofunctional images needs a close cooperation beetween different communities. On one hand, it is important to relate the acquired signal in each of the different imaging modalities (fMRI, SPECT, PET, MEG, EEG) to the physiological behavior of the brain. On the other hand, it is crucial to extract from this signal only the pertinent part and discard all the artefacts. Finally, designing an integrated system from the signal acquisition to its interpretation needs to understand all these topics.

Registration is an important poblem in medical image processing and has been quite well studied. However, in most applications, we need to know more than just the value of the result: we need to evaluate its accuracy. In the statistical framework, this means going from first order to second order statistics.

We have shown that the determination of second order statistics in medical images processing not only possible but necessary to ensure a correct interpretation of measurements. We have developped a generic framework to tackle these types of problems but there is still some work to be done for the matching and multiple registration parts, as for the uncertainty of curve, surface or volume based registration.

Non-related proteins can have very different structures, but when they share a common biological function, often they share a common 3D substructure that realizes this function: this is a motif. Here, we investigate here a geometric method to detect such similarities between two protein structures.

When several instances of the same motif are known in different proteins, it is useful to merge the geometric and chemical information of each observation in order to obtain a much more accurate model of the motif. We demonstrate here how this could be done with the heme binding motif.

My research work is mainly focused on designing in silico models of human organs and medical image analysis methods using these     models as prior knowledge and predictive tools. This knowledge can be at the anatomical, biomechanical or physiological levels.

To achieve this goal, I work in different scientific topics, like image processing, mesh generation, numerical analysis of physiological models, mesh adaptation to given data sets, parallel computing and graphical visualisation. To validate such models, I also work on the fusion of information from different modalities. As an in silico organ integrates anatomy, biomechanics and physiology, observations have to be made at these 3 levels as well.

Medical imaging is a unique way to observe the human body in vivo. As the modelling of living tissues should be at the same scale as what is observable in vivo, it is really important to be able to integrate the clinical information from the medical images into the models.

The main work on medical imaging is extracting quantitative parameters or interest regions. My research on these tasks is mainly concentrated on segmentation with deformable models and preprocessing, like anisotropic filtering, for denoising.

This work takes place in the Cooperative Research Initiative named REGulation of Ovulation(REGLO). This CRI aims to study the follicular development in mammals, and proposes mathematical models that allow to follow the granulosa cell population, and then to predict the outcome of the follicular development (ovulation or degeneration) with respect to the hormonal environment. To provide the developed models with quantitative data, this work aims at reconstructing a 3-D image of the ewe's ovary from a series of 2-D stained histologic images.

The cardiac fiber architecture plays an important role in elecrical and mechanical properties.The access to this information in vivo, which means on patients, is still a very challenging task. Obviously histological slices of the heart are not available non-invasively. The other way to obtain this information would be to acquire DTI of the heart since we know there is a correlation with the cardiac fiber architecture. Unfortunately this kind of acquisition requires an acquisition time and and resolution of acquisition which are too high considering the motion of the heart. Until now analytical models or single acquisition were used. We propose here to build a statistical model more accurate and realistic than analytical models and more generic than a single acuisition.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Predominantly, it is a disease of the "white matter" tissue. In people affected by MS, patches of damage called plaques or lesions appear in seemingly random areas of the CNS white matter. At the site of a lesion, a nerve insulating material, called myelin, is lost. The quantification of the number of lesions, as well as their volume, could be of interest to assess the severity of the disease, and the success of a therapy. These lesions are of different types, and can not be all distinguished in one MR image: therefore, to better charaterize them, several sequences are acquired (T1 weighted, with and without Gd, T2-weighted, PD-weighted). We are the interested in developping classification and segmentation algorithms that will take advantage of all the available sequences to yield precise quantifications of the lesions in MS patients.

The aim of this work is to develop new methods of cardiac kinetic analysis. These have to be based on isotopic data and without segmentation. Two methods have been developed. The 2D isotopic kinetic analysis is an improvement of the currently reference method. Both of them are based on the same principle but the 2D isotopic kinetic analysis is done in a 3D mask.

The main subject of this work is the rigid registration of surfaces dedicated to VirtualScope, a per-operative guiding system designed for oral implants surgery. It is based on a purely statistical approach. We first show how to compute and maximize a likelihood, based on a model of the data noise, for the landmarks registration problem. This approach justifies the use of the ICP algorithm, and a new multi-scale variant named ICP/EM, which improves accuracy, speed and robustness. We introduce new noise models specifically designed for the registration of sampled and noised surfaces. We discuss about the theoretical prediction of the registration accuracy, and use it for guiding the data acquisition. We analyze in detail the experimental performances of the algorithm, and provide methods for setting optimally the parameters and ensuring the correctness of registration results. The resulting algorithm is perfectly suited to the VirtualScope application. The second part of this work deals with the more general problem of the statistical modelisation of sampled and noised curves and surfaces. Based on previous works on Saliency and Tensor Voting notions, it defines a vote field that represent the probability of a curve or surface element, knowing another element. We provide basic yet easy to implement examples of such a field, which can handle the surface shape, the sampling strategy and the measurement errors. We apply them successfully to the registration problem, and suggest to use them to derive Bayesian methods to virtually all other computer vision problems involving sampled and noised curves and surfaces. This work could lead to the design of a common statistical and multi-scale framework for these various methods.

This paper describes the construction of an atlas of the human basal ganglia. The successive steps of the construction were as follows. First a postmortem specimen was subjected to a MRI acquisition prior to extraction of the brain from the skull. The brain was then cryosectioned (70 mum thickness). One section out of ten (80 sections) was Nissl-stained with cresyl violet, another series of 80 sections was immunostained for the calcium binding protein calbindin. Contours of basal ganglia nuclei including their calbindin-stained functional subdivisions, fiber bundles and ventricles (n=80 structures) were traced from histological sections and digitized. A novelty of this atlas is the MRI acquisition, which represents the core data element of the study. MRI was used for the coregistration of the atlas data and permitted, through multimodal (Nissl, calbindin, images of cryosectioning, T1 and T2 MRI) and 3D optimization, the production of anatomically and geometrically consistent 3D surfaces, which can be sliced through any desired orientation. The atlas MRI is also used for its deformation to provide accurate conformation to the MRI of living patients, thus adding information at the histological level to the patient's MRI volume. This latter aspect will be presented in a forthcoming paper.

Introduction. Cognitive impairment is frequent in relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis and is often diagnosed after disruption of occupational and social relations. METHODS: We studied at baseline a homogeneous population of 32 RRMS patients, diagnosed for less than 5 years, with spontaneous memory complaints, and 20 controls. Sixteen patients were followed for 2 years, combining physical examination, neuropsychological tests, and brain MRI. Neuropsychological tests used evaluated memory capacities, attentional capacities, executive functions, language, and visuo-constructive praxis. Lesion load on brain MRI was measured with semi-automatic segmentation procedures and manual control. RESULTS: Eighty percent of patients presented cognitive impairment, and this proportion was higher than that found in the literature. These disorders were more marked for verbal episodic memory, attention, and executive functions. Patients with brain MRI that initially fulfilled the Barkhof criteria and those with callous lesions had more memory disorders. No link between global T1 and T2 lesion loads and neuropsychological scores was found. A statistical link between posterior fossa lesions and attentional disorders was shown. In the longitudinal follow-up, patients had better performances in memory and attentional domains, and a lower number of cognitive domains with dysfunction for each patient. This improvement on neuropsychological tests, whereas EDSS levels were stable, underlined a possible test-retest effect. CONCLUSION: During the initial phase of the disease, most of the relapsing remitting patients present a mild cognitive impairment. Early detection, therapeutic propositions, and recognition of disorders are necessary.

Cardiovascular diseases remain the primary cause of death in developed countries. In most cases, exploration of possibly underlying coronary artery pathologies is performed using X-ray coronary angiography. Current clinical routine in coronary angiography is directly conducted in 2-D projection images from several static viewing angles. However, for diagnosis and treatment purposes, coronary artery reconstruction is highly suitable. The purpose of this study is to provide physicians with a 3-D model of coronary arteries, e.g. for absolute three-dimensional measures for lesion assessment, instead of direct projective measures deduced from the images, which are highly dependent on the viewing angle. In this article, we propose a novel method to reconstruct coronary arteries from one single rotational X-ray projection sequence. As a side result, we also obtain an estimation of the coronary artery motion. Our method consists of 3 main consecutive steps: (1) 3-D reconstruction of coronary artery centerlines, including respiratory motion compensation, (2) coronary artery 4-D motion computation, and (3) 3-D tomographic reconstruction of coronary arteries, involving compensation for respiratory and cardiac motions. We present some experiments on clinical datasets, and the feasibility of a true 3-D Quantitative Coronary Analysis is demonstrated.

OBJECTIVE: Detailed information on microvascular network anatomy is a requirement for understanding several aspects of microcirculation, including oxygen transport, distributions of pressure, and wall shear stress in microvessels, regulation of blood flow, and interpretation of hemodynamically based functional imaging methods, but very few quantitative data on the human brain microcirculation are available. The main objective of this study is to propose a new method to analyze this microcirculation. METHODS: From thick sections of india ink-injected human brain, using confocal laser microscopy, the authors developed algorithms adapted to very large data sets to automatically extract and analyze center lines together with diameters of thousands of brain microvessels within a large cortex area. RESULTS: Direct comparison between the original data and the processed vascular skeletons demonstrated the high reliability of this method and its capability to manage a large amount of data, from which morphometry and topology of the cerebral microcirculation could be derived. CONCLUSIONS: Among the many parameters that can be analyzed by this method, the capillary size, the frequency distributions of diameters and lengths, the fractal nature of these networks, and the depth-related density of vessels are all vital features for an adequate model of cerebral microcirculation.

The study of cerebral microvascular networks requires high-resolution images. However, to obtain statistically relevant results, a large area of the brain (several square millimeters) must be analyzed. This leads us to consider huge images, too large to be loaded and processed at once in the memory of a standard computer. To consider a large area, a compact representation of the vessels is required. The medial axis is the preferred tool for this application. To extract it, a dedicated skeletonization algorithm is proposed. Numerous approaches already exist which focus on computational efficiency. However, they all implicitly assume that the image can be completely processed in the computer memory, which is not realistic with the large images considered here. We present in this paper a skeletonization algorithm that processes data locally (in subimages) while preserving global properties (i.e., homotopy). We then show some results obtained on a mosaic of three-dimensional images acquired by confocal microscopy.

Tensors are nowadays a common source of geometric information. In this paper, we propose to endow the tensor space with an affine-invariant Riemannian metric. We demonstrate that it leads to strong theoretical properties: the cone of positive definite symmetric matrices is replaced by a regular and complete manifold without boundaries (null eigenvalues are at the infinity), the geodesic between two tensors and the mean of a set of tensors are uniquely defined, etc. We have previously shown that the Riemannian metric provides a powerful framework for generalizing statistics to manifolds. In this paper, we show that it is also possible to generalize to tensor fields many important geometric data processing algorithms such as interpolation, filtering, diffusion and restoration of missing data. For instance, most interpolation and Gaussian filtering schemes can be tackled efficiently through a weighted mean computation. Linear and anisotropic diffusion schemes can be adapted to our Riemannian framework, through partial differential evolution equations, provided that the metric of the tensor space is taken into account. For that purpose, we provide intrinsic numerical schemes to compute the gradient and Laplace-Beltrami operators. Finally, to enforce the fidelity to the data (either sparsely distributed tensors or complete tensors fields) we propose least-squares criteria based on our invariant Riemannian distance which are particularly simple and efficient to solve.

This manuscript tackles the reconstruction of 3D volumes via mono-modal registration of series of 2D biological images (histological sections, autoradiographs, cryosections, etc.). The process of acquiring these images typically induces composite transformations that we model as a number of rigid or affine local transformations embedded in an elastic one. We propose a registration approach closely derived from this model. Given a pair of input images, we first compute a dense similarity field between them with a block matching algorithm. We use as a similarity measure an extension of the classical correlation coefficient that improves the consistency of the field. A hierarchical clustering algorithm then automatically partitions the field into a number of classes from which we extract independent pairs of sub-images. Our clustering algorithm relies on the Earth mover's distribution metric and is additionally guided by robust least-square estimation of the transformations associated with each cluster. Finally, the pairs of sub-images are, independently, affinely registered and a hybrid affine/non-linear interpolation scheme is used to compose the output registered image. We investigate the behavior of our approach on several batches of histological data and discuss its sensitivity to parameters and noise.

The ever-rising diffusion of cellular phones has brought about an increased concern for the possible consequences of electromagnetic radiation on human health. Possible thermal effects have been investigated, via experimentation or simulation, by several research projects in the last decade. Concerning numerical modeling, the power absorption in a user's head is generally computed using discretized models built from clinical MRI data. The vast majority of such numerical studies have been conducted using Finite Differences Time Domain methods, although strong limitations of their accuracy are due to heterogeneity, poor definition of the detailed structures of head tissues (staircasing effects), etc. In order to propose numerical modeling using Finite Element or Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain methods, reliable automated tools for the unstructured discretization of human heads are also needed. Results presented in this article aim at filling the gap between human head MRI images and the accurate numerical modeling of wave propagation in biological tissues and its thermal effects.

In studies on animal models of human brain pathologies, three-dimensional reconstruction from histological sections is particularly useful when assessing the morphologic, functional and biochemical changes induced by pathology. It allows assessing lesion heterogeneity in planes different from the cutting plane and allows correlating the histology with images obtained in vivo, such as by means of magnetic resonance imaging. To create a 3D volume from autoradiographic sections with minimal distortion, both cryosectioning as well as section registration need to be optimal. This paper describes a strategy whereby four external fiducial markers are positioned outside the rat brain with the use of a low temperature brain embedding procedure. The fiducial markers proposed here can be rapidly added to any frozen tissue block with no impact on the subsequent histological operations. Since embedding is performed at a low temperature, no tissue degradation occurs due to sample heating. The markers enable robust and almost error free registration, even in the presence of missing sections and poor image quality. Furthermore, the markers may be used to partially correct for global distortions.

Saccular aneurisms illustrate usefulness and possible techniques of image-based modeling of flow in diseased vessels. Aneurism flow is investigated in order to estimate the rupture risk, assuming that the pressure is the major factor and that high-pressure zones are correlated to within-wall strong-stress concentrations. Computational flow is also aimed at providing additional arguments for the treatment strategy. Angiographies of aneurismal vessels of large and medium size are processed to provide three-dimensional reconstruction of the vessel region of interest. Different reconstruction techniques are used for a side and a terminal aneurisms. Reconstruction techniques may lead to different geometries especially with poor input data. The associated facetisation is improved to get a computation-adapted surface triangulation, after a treatment of vessel ends and mesh adaptation. Once the volumic mesh is obtained, the pulsatile flow of an incompressible Newtonian blood is computed using in vivo non-invasive flowmetry and the finite element method. High pressure zones are observed in the aneurism cavity. The pressure magnitude in the aneurism, the location and the size of high pressure zones depend mainly on the aneurism implantation on the vessel wall and its orientation with respect to the blood flux in the upstream vessel. The stronger the blood impacts on the aneurismal wall the higher the pressure. The state of the aneurism neck, where a high-pressure zone can occur, and the location of the aneurism, with an easy access or not, give arguments for the choice between coiling and surgical clipping. Mesh size and 3D reconstruction procedure affect the numerical results. Helpful qualitative data are provided rather than accurate quantitative results in the context of multimodeling.

We present a new algorithm to register 3D pre-operative Magnetic Resonance (MR) images to intra-operative MR images of the brain which have undergone brain shift. This algorithm relies on a robust estimation of the deformation from a sparse noisy set of measured displacements. We propose a new framework to co mpute the displacement field in an iterative process, allowing the solution to gradually move from an approximation formulation (minimizing the sum of a re gularization term and a data error term) to an interpolation formulation (least square minimization of the data error term). An outlier rejection step is i ntroduced in this gradual registration process using a weighted least trimmed squares approach, aiming at improving the robustness of the algorithm. We use a patient-specific model discretized with the finite element method (FEM) in order to ensure a realistic mechanical behavior of the brain tissue. To meet the clinical time constraint, we parallelized the slowest step of the algorithm so that we can perform a full 3D image registration in 35 seconds ( including the image update time) on a heterogeneous cluster of 15 PCs. The algorithm has been tested on six cases of brain tumor resection, presenting a brain shift of up to 14 mm. The results show a good ability to recover la rge displacements, and a limited decrease of accuracy near the tumor resection cavity.

We propose a new model to simulate the 3D growth of glioblastomas multiforma (GBMs), the most aggressive glial tumors. The GBM speed of growth depends on the invaded tissue: faster in white than in gray matter, it is stopped by the dura or the ventricles. These different structures are introduced into the model using an atlas matching technique. The atlas includes both the segmentations of anatomical structures and diffusion information in white matter fibers. We use the finite element method (FEM) to simulate the invasion of the GBM in the brain parenchyma and its mechanical interaction with the invaded structures (mass effect). Depending on the considered tissue, the former effect is modeled with a reaction-diffusion or a Gompertz equation, while the latter is based on a linear elastic brain constitutive equation. In addition, we propose a new coupling equation taking into account the mechanical influence of the tumor cells on the invaded tissues. The tumor growth simulation is assessed by comparing the 	extit{in-silico} GBM growth with the real growth observed on two magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a patient acquired with six months difference. Results show the feasibility of this new conceptual approach and justifies its further validation.

This paper proposes an efficient method for removing tetrahedra from a tetrahedral mesh while keeping its manifold property. We first define precisely the notion of manifold tetrahedral mesh and stress its relevance in the context of real-time surgery simulation. We then provide a method for removing a tetrahedron that complies with the manifold definition. This removal may require in some cases the removal of neighboring tetrahedra. After providing an exhaustive description of the tetrahedron removal algorithm, its efficiency is evaluated for different mesh configurations. This algorithm is currently used in the context of real-time surgery simulation where the action of an ultrasonic lancet can be simulated by the removal of small set of tetrahedra from a tetrahedralisation.

Chamfer distances are widely used in image analysis and many authors have investigated the computation of optimal chamfer mask coefficients. Unfortunately, these methods are not systematized: calculations have to be conducted manually for every mask size or image anisotropy. Since image acquisition (e.g. medical imaging) can lead to discrete anisotropic grids with unpredictable anisotropy value, automated calculation of chamfer mask coefficients becomes mandatory for e cient distance map computations. This article presents an automatic construction for chamfer masks of arbitrary sizes. This allows, first, to derive analytically the relative error with respect to the Euclidean distance, in any 3-D anisotropic lattice, and second, to compute optimal chamfer coefficients. In addition, the resulting chamfer map verifies discrete norm conditions.

Pulmonary hypertensive disease is assessed by quantification of pulmonary vascular resistance. Pulmonary total arterial compliance is also an indicator of pulmonary hypertensive disease. However, because of difficulties in measuring compliance, it is rarely used. We describe a method of measuring pulmonary arterial compliance utilizing magnetic resonance (MR) flow data and invasive pressure measurements. Seventeen patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension or congenital heart disease requiring preoperative assessment underwent MR-guided cardiac catheterization. Invasive manometry was used to measure pulmonary arterial pressure, and phase-contrast MR was used to measure flow at baseline and at 20 ppm nitric oxide (NO). Total arterial compliance was calculated using the pulse pressure method (parameter optimization of the 2-element windkessel model) and the ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure. There was good agreement between the two estimates of compliance (r = 0.98, P 10% in response to 20 ppm NO. As a population, the increase did not reach statistical significance. There was an inverse relation between compliance and resistance (r = 0.89, P < 0.001) and between compliance and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). We have demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying total arterial compliance using an MR method.

We describe an automatic and reproducible method to analyze the histological design of the cerebral cortex as applied to brain sections stained to reveal myelinated fibers. The technique provides an evaluation of the distribution of myelination across the width of the cortical mantle in accordance with a model of its curvature and its intrinsic geometry. The profile lines along which the density of staining is measured are generated from the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) that models the intermediate layers of the cortex. Cortical profiles are classified according to significant components that emerge from wavelet analysis. Intensity profiles belonging to each distinct class are normalized and averaged to produce area-specific templates of cortical myelo-architecture.

In this study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether visual mental images retinotopically activate early visual cortex. Six participants were instructed to visualize or view horizontally or vertically oriented flashing bow-tie shaped stimuli. When compared to baseline, imagery globally activated Area V1. When the activation evoked by the stimuli at the different orientations was directly compared, distinct spatial activation patterns were obtained for each orientation in most participants. Not only was the topography of the activation patterns from imagery similar to the topography obtained with a corresponding visual perception task, but it closely matched the individual cortical representation of either the horizontal or the vertical visual field meridians. These findings strongly support that visual imagery and perception share low-level anatomical substrate and functional processes. Binding of spatial features is suggested as one possible mechanism.

INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed management of patients with multiple sclerosis. The exact contribution of brain MRI remains a subject of debate, but it is generally considered to provide a more specific and more sensitive outcome measure for monitoring purposes and for testing new therapies. The choice of MRI techniques, and measurement reproducibility for multiple sclerosis brain lesions are not defined with precision for routine practice. There are many sources of error when comparing successive images which can be overcome to some extent with repositioning and image processing techniques. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of image repositioning on treatment decision-making for twelve relapsing remitting patients. Brain MRIs were performed every three months for a one-year period. Two neurologists interpreted the non-repositioned and repositioned images giving their analysis of changes in the lesions visualized on the T2 sequences and their therapeutic decisions. RESULTS: For the first neurologist, analysis of the non-repositioned images yielded six patients whose lesions had worsened while for the repositioned images there were only three. For the second neurologist, four patients had more lesions with the non-repositioned images and only three with repositioning. The subjective interpretations were the same for the two neurologists when they used repositioned images. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison by two neurologists of non-repositioned and repositioned MRI, with no other image processing, affected the analysis and in certain cases propositions for treatment.

Strains of mice, through breeding or the disruption of normal genetic pathways, are widely used to model human diseases. Atlases are an invaluable aid in understanding the impact of such manipulations by providing a standard for comparison. We have developed a digital atlas of the adult C57BL/6J mouse brain as a comprehensive framework for storing and accessing the myriad types of information about the mouse brain. Our implementation was constructed using several different imaging techniques: magnetic resonance microscopy, blockface imaging, classical histology and immunohistochemistry. Along with raw and annotated images, it contains database management systems and a set of tools for comparing information from different techniques. The framework allows facile correlation of results from different animals, investigators or laboratories by establishing a canonical representation of the mouse brain and providing the tools for the insertion of independent data into the same space as the atlas. This tool will aid in managing the increasingly complex and voluminous amounts of information about the mammalian brain. It provides a framework that encompasses genetic information in the context of anatomical imaging and holds tremendous promise for producing new insights into the relationship between genotype and phenotype. We describe a suite of tools that enables the independent entry of other types of data, facile retrieval of information and straightforward display of images. Thus, the atlas becomes a framework for managing complex genetic and epigenetic information about the mouse brain. The atlas and associated tools may be accessed at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/MAP.

In the past years, the development of 3-D medical imaging has enabled the 3-D imaging of in vivo tissues, from an anatomical (MR, CT) or even functional (fMRI, PET, SPECT) point of view. However, despite immense technological progress, the resolution of these images is still short of the level of anatomical or functional details that in vitro imaging (e.g. histology, autoradiography) permits. The motivation of this work is to compare fMRI activations to activations observed in autoradiographic images from the same animals. We aim to fuse post-mortem autoradiographic data with a pre-mortem anatomical MR image. We first reconstruct a 3-D volume from the 2-D autoradiographic sections, coherent both in geometry and intensity. Then, this volume is fused with the MR image. This way, we ensure that the reconstructed 3-D volume can be superimposed onto the MR image that represents the reference anatomy. We demonstrate that this fusion can be achieved by using only simple global transformations (rigid and/or affine, 2-D and 3-D), while yielding very satisfactory results.

The problem of increasing the slice resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) images without a loss in signal-to-noise ratio is considered. In standard fMRI experiments, increasing the slice resolution by a certain factor decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the images with the same factor. For this purpose an adapted EPI MRI acquisition protocol is proposed, allowing one to acquire slice-shifted images from which one can generate interpolated super-resolution images, with an increased resolution in the slice direction. To solve the problem of correctness and robustness of the created super-resolution images from these slice-shifted datasets, the use of discontinuity preserving regularization methods is proposed. Tests on real morphological, synthetic functional, and real functional MR datasets have been performed, by comparing the obtained super-resolution datasets with high-resolution reference datasets. In the morphological experiments the image spatial resolution of the different types of images are compared. In the synthetic and real fMRI experiments, on the other hand, the quality of the different datasets is studied as function of their resulting activation maps. From the results obtained in this study, we conclude that the proposed super-resolution techniques can both improve the signal-to-noise ratio and augment the detectability of small activated areas in fMRI image sets acquired with thicker slices.

Human functional MRI studies frequently reveal the joint activation of parietal and of lateral and mesial frontal areas during various cognitive tasks. To analyze the geometrical organization of those networks, we used an automatized clustering algorithm that parcels out sets of areas based on their similar profile of task-related activations or deactivations. This algorithm allowed us to reanalyze published fMRI data (Simon, O., Mangin, J.F., Cohen, L., Le Bihan, D., Dehaene, S., 2002. Topographical layout of hand, eye, calculation, and language-related areas in the human parietal lobe. Neuron 33, 475-487) and to reproduce the previously observed geometrical organization of activations for saccades, attention, grasping, pointing, calculation, and language processing in the parietal lobe. Further, we show that this organization extends to lateral and mesial prefrontal regions. Relative to the parietal lobe, the prefrontal functional geometry is characterized by a partially symmetrical anteroposterior ordering of activations, a decreased representation of effector-specific tasks, and a greater emphasis on higher cognitive functions of attention, higher-order spatial representation, calculation, and language. Anatomically, our results in humans are closely homologous to the known connectivity of parietal and frontal regions in the macaque monkey.

Recently, radiotherapy possibilities have been dramatically increased by software and hardware developments. Improvements in medical imaging devices have increased the importance of three-dimensional ({3D}) images as the complete examination of these data by a physician is not possible. Computer techniques are needed to present only the pertinent information for clinical applications. We describe a technique for an automatic 3D reconstruction of the eye and CT scan merging with fundus photographs (retinography). The final result is a "virtual eye" to guide ocular tumor protontherapy. First, we make specific software to automatically detect the position of the eyeball, the optical nerve, and the lens in the CT scan. We obtain a 3D eye reconstruction using this automatic method. Second, we describe the retinography and demonstrate the projection of this modality. Then we combine retinography with a reconstructed eye, using a CT scan to get a virtual eye. The result is a computer 3D scene rendering a virtual eye into a skull reconstruction. The virtual eye can be useful for the simulation, the planning, and the control of ocular tumor protontherapy. It can be adapted to treatment planning to automatically detect eye and organs at risk position. It should be highlighted that all the image processing is fully automatic to allow the reproduction of results, this is a useful property to conduct a consistent clinical validation. The automatic localization of the organ at risk in a CT scan or an MRI by automatic software could be of great interest for radiotherapy in the future for comparison of one patient at different times, the comparison of different treatments centers, the possibility of pooling results of different treatments centers, the automatic generation of doses-volumes histograms, the comparison between different treatment planning for the same patient and the comparison between different patients at the same time. It will also be less time consuming.

Although numerous methods to register brains of different individuals have been proposed, no work has been done, as far as we know, to evaluate and objectively compare the performances of different nonrigid (or elastic) registration methods on the same database of subjects. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework, based on global and local measures of the relevance of the registration. We have chosen to focus more particularly on the matching of cortical areas, since intersubject registration methods are dedicated to anatomical and functional normalization, and also because other groups have shown the relevance of such registration methods for deep brain structures. Experiments were conducted using 6 methods on a database of 18 subjects. The global measures used show that the quality of the registration is directly related to the transformation's degrees of freedom. More surprisingly, local measures based on the matching of cortical sulci did not show significant differences between rigid and non rigid methods.

Standard group analyses of fMRI data rely on spatial and temporal averaging of individuals. This averaging operation is only sensible when the mean is a good representation of the group. This is not the case if subjects are not homogeneous, and it is therefore a major concern in fMRI studies to assess this group homogeneity. We present a method that provides relevant distances or similarity measures between temporal series of brain functional images belonging to different subjects. The method allows a multivariate comparison between data sets of several subjects in the time or in the space domain. These analyses assess the global intersubject variability before averaging subjects and drawing conclusions across subjects, at the population level. We adapt the RV coefficient to measure meaningful spatial or temporal similarities and use multidimensional scaling to give a visual representation of each subject's position with respect to other subjects in the group. We also provide a measure for detecting subjects that may be outliers. Results show that the method is a powerful tool to detect subjects with specific temporal or spatial patterns, and that, despite the apparent loss of information, restricting the analysis to a homogeneous subgroup of subjects does not reduce the statistical sensitivity of standard group fMRI analyses.

OBJECT: The aim of this study was to correlate the clinical improvement in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) treated using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with the precise anatomical localization of stimulating electrodes. METHODS: Localization was determined by superimposing figures from an anatomical atlas with postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in each patient. This approach was validated by an analysis of experimental and clinical MR images of the electrode, and the development of a three-dimensional (3D) atlas-MR imaging coregistration method. The PD motor score was assessed through two contacts for each of two electrodes implanted in 10 patients: the "therapeutic contact" and the "distant contact" (that is, the next but one to the therapeutic contact). Seventeen therapeutic contacts were located within or on the border of the STN, most of which were associated with significant improvement of the four PD symptoms tested. Therapeutic contacts located in other structures (zona incerta, lenticular fasciculus, or midbrain reticular formation) were also linked to a significant positive effect. Stimulation applied through distant contacts located in the STN improved symptoms of PD, whereas that delivered through distant contacts in the remaining structures had variable effects ranging from worsening of symptoms to their improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have demonstrated that 3D atlas-MR imaging coregistration is a reliable method for the precise localization of DBS electrodes on postoperative MR images. In addition, they have confirmed that although the STN is the main target during DBS treatment for PD, stimulation of surrounding regions, particularly the zona incerta or the lenticular fasciculus, can also improve symptoms of PD.

This anatomic study presents an analysis of the distribution of calbindin immunohistochemistry in the human striatopallidal complex. Entire brains were sectioned perpendicularly to the mid-commissural line into 70-microm-thick sections. Every tenth section was immunostained for calbindin. Calbindin labeling exhibited a gradient on the basis of which three different regions were defined: poorly labeled, strongly labeled, and intermediate. Corresponding contours were traced in individual sections and reformatted as three-dimensional structures. The poorly labeled region corresponded to the dorsal part of the striatum and to the central part of the pallidum. The strongly labeled region included the ventral part of the striatum, the subcommissural part of the external pallidum but also the adjacent portion of its suscommissural part, and the anterior pole of the internal pallidum. The intermediate region was located between the poorly and strongly labeled regions. As axonal tracing and immunohistochemical studies in monkeys show a similar pattern, poorly, intermediate, and strongly labeled regions were considered as the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic territories of the human striatopallidal complex, respectively. However, the boundaries between these territories were not sharp but formed gradients of labeling, which suggests overlapping between adjacent territories. Similarly, the ventral boundary of the striatopallidal complex was blurred, suggesting a structural intermingling with the substantia innominata. This three-dimensional partitioning of the human striatopallidal complex could help to define functional targets for high-frequency stimulation with greater accuracy and help to identify new stimulation sites.

Given a finite set of points ${\cal P}$ in ${\R}^d$, the diameter of $\cal P$ is defined as the maximum distance between two points of $\cal P$. We propose a very simple algorithm to compute the diameter of a finite set of points. Although the algorithm is not worst-case optimal, an extensive experimental study has shown that it is extremely fast for a large variety of point distributions. In addition, we propose a comparison with the recent approach of Har-Peled and derive hybrid algorithms to combine advantages of both approaches.

The study of temporal series of medical images can be helpful for physicians to perform pertinent diagnoses and to help them in the follow-up of a patient: in some diseases, lesions, tumors or anatomical structures vary over time in size, position, composition, etc., either because of a natural pathological process or under the effect of a drug or a therapy. It is a laborious and subjective task to visually and manually analyze such images. Thus the objective of this work was to automatically detect regions with apparent local volume variation with a vector field operator applied to the local displacement field obtained after a non-rigid registration between two successive temporal images. On the other hand, quantitative measurements, such as the volume variation of lesions or segmentation of evolving lesions, are important. By studying the information of apparent shrinking areas in the direct and reverse displacement fields between images, we are able to segment evolving lesions. Then we propose a method to segment lesions in a whole temporal series of images. In this article we apply this approach to automatically detect and segment multiple sclerosis lesions that evolve in time series of MRI scans of the brain. At this stage, we have only applied the approach to a few experimental cases to demonstrate its potential. A clinical validation remains to be done, which will require important additional work.

This paper presents an original method for three-dimensional elastic registration of multimodal images. We propose to make use of a scheme that iterates between correcting for intensity differences between images and performing standard monomodal registration. The core of our contribution resides in providing a method that finds the transformation that maps the intensities of one image to those of another. It makes the assumption that there are at most two functional dependencies between the intensities of structures present in the images to register, and relies on robust estimation techniques to evaluate these functions. We provide results showing successful registration between several imaging modalities involving segmentations, T1 magnetic resonance (MR), T2 MR, proton density (PD) MR and computed tomography (CT). We also argue that our intensity modeling may be more appropriate than mutual information (MI) in the context of evaluating high-dimensional deformations, as it puts more constraints on the parameters to be estimated and, thus, permits a better search of the parameter space.

Apathy is the most frequent behavioral symptom in Alzheimer's disease and is also frequently reported in other brain organic disorders occurring in the elderly. Based on the literature, we hypothesized that apathy was related to an anterior cingulate hypofunction. Forty-one subjects were studied. According to ICD 10 diagnostic criteria, 28 patients had Alzheimer dementia (demented: diagnostic group 1), and 13 had organic personality disorders or mild cognitive impairment not attributable to dementia (nondemented: diagnostic group 2). Apathy was evaluated by the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory. As a result each diagnostic group was divided into two symptomatic subgroups: apathetic or nonapathetic. Brain perfusion was measured by 99mTc-labeled bicisate (ECD) brain SPECT and the images were compared using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM96). We began by comparing apathetic vs nonapathetic patients, whatever their diagnostic group (whole population), then analyzed them within each group. Twenty-one subjects were apathetic (14 in group 1 and 7 in group 2) and 20 were not (14 in group 1 and 6 in group 2). For the whole population, the Z map showed a significant decrease in ECD uptake for the apathetic patients in the anterior cingulate (P < 0.002) bilaterally. This area was also identified as hypoactive by SPM analysis in the demented (P < 0.035) and in the nondemented (P < 0.02) apathetic patient groups. Finally, conjunction analysis indicated that the anterior cingulate was the common hypoactive structure of the two apathetic subgroups (Z = 4.35, P < 0.0009). These results point to a close relationship between apathy and the anterior cingulate region.

We present a new image-based technique to rigidly register intraoperative three-dimensional ultrasound (US) with preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images. Automatic registration is achieved by maximization of a similarity measure which generalizes the correlation ratio, and whose novelty is to incorporate multivariate information from the MR data (intensity and gradient). In addition, the similarity measure is built upon a robust intensity-based distance measure, which makes it possible to handle a variety of US artifacts. A cross-validation study has been carried out using a number of phantom and clinical data. This indicates that the method is quite robust and that the worst registration errors are of the order of the MR image resolution.

OBJECTIVE: To improve the planning of hepatic surgery, we have developed a fully automatic anatomical, pathological, and functional segmentation of the liver derived from a spiral CT scan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a 2 mm-thick enhanced spiral CT scan, the first stage automatically delineates skin, bones, lungs, kidneys, and spleen by combining the use of thresholding, mathematical morphology, and distance maps. Next, a reference 3D model is immersed in the image and automatically deformed to the liver contours. Then an automatic Gaussian fitting on the imaging histogram estimates the intensities of parenchyma, vessels, and lesions. This first result is next improved through an original topological and geometrical analysis, providing an automatic delineation of lesions and veins. Finally, a topological and geometrical analysis based on medical knowledge provides hepatic functional information that is invisible in medical imaging: portal vein labeling and hepatic anatomical segmentation according to the Couinaud classification. RESULTS: Clinical validation performed on more than 30 patients shows that delineation of anatomical structures by this method is often more sensitive and more specific than manual delineation by a radiologist. CONCLUSION: This study describes the methodology used to create the automatic segmentation of the liver with delineation of important anatomical, pathological, and functional structures from a routine CT scan. Using the methods proposed in this study, we have confirmed the accuracy and utility of the creation of a 3D liver model compared with the conventional reading of the CT scan by a radiologist. This work may allow improved preoperative planning of hepatic surgery by more precisely delineating liver pathology and its relationship to normal hepatic structures. In the future, this data may be integrated with computer-assisted surgery and thus represents a first step towards the development of an augmented-reality surgical system.

Detection of tubular structures in 3D images is an important issue for vascular detection in medical imaging. We present in this paper a new approach for centerline detection and reconstruction of 3D tubular structures. Several models of vessels are introduced for estimating the sensivity of the image second order derivatives according to elliptical cross-section, to curvature of the axis, or to partial volume effects. Our approach uses a multiscale analysis for extracting vessels of different sizes according to the scale. For a given model of vessel, we derive an analytic expression of the relationship between the radius of the structure and the scale at which it is detected. The algorithm gives both centerline extraction and radius estimation of the vessels allowing their reconstruction. The method has been tested on both synthetic and real images, with encouraging results. This work was done in collaboration with GEMS (General Electric Medical Systems, Buc, France).

PROBLEM/BACKGROUND: In order to help hepatic surgical planning we perfected automatic 3D reconstruction of patients from conventional CT-scan, and interactive visualization and virtual resection tools. TOOLS AND METHODS: From a conventional abdominal CT-scan, we have developed several methods allowing the automatic 3D reconstruction of skin, bones, kidneys, lung, liver, hepatic lesions, and vessels. These methods are based on deformable modeling or thresholding algorithms followed by the application of mathematical morphological operators. From these anatomical and pathological models, we have developed a new framework for translating anatomical knowledge into geometrical and topological constraints. More precisely, our approach allows to automatically delineate the hepatic and portal veins but also to label the portal vein and finally to build an anatomical segmentation of the liver based on Couinaud definition which is currently used by surgeons all over the world. Finally, we have developed a user friendly interface for the 3D visualization of anatomical and pathological structures, the accurate evaluation of volumes and distances and for the virtual hepatic resection along a user-defined cutting plane. RESULTS: A validation study on a 30 patients database gives 2 mm of precision for liver delineation and less than 1 mm for all other anatomical and pathological structures delineation. An in vivo validation performed during surgery also showed that anatomical segmentation is more precise than the delineation performed by a surgeon based on external landmarks. This surgery planning system has been routinely used by our medical partner, and this has resulted in an improvement of the planning and performance of hepatic surgery procedures. CONCLUSION: We have developed new tools for hepatic surgical planning allowing a better surgery through an automatic delineation and visualization of anatomical and pathological structures. These tools represent a first step towards the development of an augmented reality system combined with computer assisted tele-robotical surgery.

We present a general method to study the dissymmetry of anatomical structures such as those found in the human brain. Our method relies on the estimate of 3D dissymmetry fields, the use of 3D vector field operators, and T2 statistics to compute significance maps. We also present a fully automated implementation of this method which relies mainly on the intensive use of a 3D non-rigid inter-patient matching tool. Such a tool is applied successively between the images and their symmetric versions with respect to an arbitrary plane, both to realign the images with respect to the mid-plane of the subject and to compute a dense 3D dissymmetry map. Inter-patient matching is also used to fuse the data of a population of subjects. We then describe three main application fields: the study of the normal dissymmetry within a given population, the comparison of the dissymmetry between two populations, and the detection of the significant abnormal dissymmetries of a patient with respect to a reference population. Finally, we present preliminary results illustrating these three applications for the case of the human brain.

OBJECTIVE: This article describes a preliminary work on virtual reality applied to liver surgery and discusses the repercussions of assisted surgical strategy and surgical simulation on tomorrow's surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Liver surgery is considered difficult because of the complexity and variability of the organ. Common generic tools for presurgical medical image visualization do not fulfill the requirements for the liver, restricting comprehension of a patient's specific liver anatomy. METHODS: Using data from the National Library of Medicine, a realistic three-dimensional image was created, including the envelope and the four internal arborescences. A computer interface was developed to manipulate the organ and to define surgical resection planes according to internal anatomy. The first step of surgical simulation was implemented, providing the organ with real-time deformation computation. RESULTS: The three-dimensional anatomy of the liver could be clearly visualized. The virtual organ could be manipulated and a resection defined depending on the anatomic relations between the arborescences, the tumor, and the external envelope. The resulting parts could also be visualized and manipulated. The simulation allowed the deformation of a liver model in real time by means of a realistic laparoscopic tool. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional visualization of the organ in relation to the pathology is of great help to appreciate the complex anatomy of the liver. Using virtual reality concepts (navigation, interaction, and immersion), surgical planning, training, and teaching for this complex surgical procedure may be possible. The ability to practice a given gesture repeatedly will revolutionize surgical training, and the combination of surgical planning and simulation will improve the efficiency of intervention, leading to optimal care delivery.

Surgical simulation increasingly appears to be an essential aspect of tomorrow's surgery. The development of a hepatic surgery simulator is an advanced concept calling for a new writing system which will transform the medical world: virtual reality. Virtual reality extends the perception of our five senses by representing more than the real state of things by the means of computer sciences and robotics. It consists of three concepts: immersion, navigation and interaction. Three reasons have led us to develop this simulator: the first is to provide the surgeon with a comprehensive visualisation of the organ. The second reasons is to allow for planning and surgical simulation that could be compared with the detailed flight-plan for a commercial jet pilot. The third lies in the fact that virtual reality is an integrated part of the concept of computer assisted surgical procedure. The project consists of a sophisticated simulator which must include five requirements: a) visual fidelity, b) interactivity, c) physical properties, d) physiological properties, e) sensory input and output. In this report we describe how to obtain a realistic 3D model of the liver from bi-dimensional 2D medical images for anatomical and surgical training. The introduction of a tumor and the consequent planning and virtual resection is also described, as are force feedback and real-time interaction.

We present a general scheme for automatically building a morphometric anatomical atlas. We detail each stage of the method, including the non-rigid registration algorithm, three-dimensional line averaging and statistical processes. We apply the method to obtain a quantitative atlas of skull crest lines. Finally, we use the resulting atlas to study a craniofacial disease; we show how we can obtain qualitative and quantitative results by contrasting a skull affected by a mandible deformation with the atlas.

In this paper, we present the concept of diffusing models to perform image-to-image matching. Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.

This paper reports work in progress on X-ray angiography acquired under stereotactic conditions. The objective is to be able to match multimodality images (typically MRI and X-ray) without a stereotactic frame but with stereotactic precision. We have identified potential problems and have studied them in detail. We conclude that, although the overall application is feasible, much work remains to be done on the estimation of the X-ray system conic projection and on automatic matching based on vascular structures.

PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study is to perform a blinded evaluation of a group of retrospective image registration techniques using as a gold standard a prospective, marker-based registration method. To ensure blindedness, all retrospective registrations were performed by participants who had no knowledge of the gold standard results until after their results had been submitted. A secondary goal of the project is to evaluate the importance of correcting geometrical distortion in MR images by comparing the retrospective registration error in the rectified images, i.e., those that have had the distortion correction applied, with that of the same images before rectification. METHOD: Image volumes of three modalities (CT, MR, and PET) were obtained from patients undergoing neurosurgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center on whom bone-implanted fiducial markers were mounted. These volumes had all traces of the markers removed and were provided via the Internet to project collaborators outside Vanderbilt, who then performed retrospective registrations on the volumes, calculating transformations from CT to MR and/ or from PET to MR. These investigators communicated their transformations again via the Internet to Vanderbilt, where the accuracy of each registration was evaluated. In this evaluation, the accuracy is measured at multiple volumes of interest (VOIs), i.e., areas in the brain that would commonly be areas of neurological interest. A VOI is defined in the MR image and its centroid c is determined. Then, the prospective registration is used to obtain the corresponding point c' in CT or PET. To this point, the retrospective registration is then applied, producing c" in MR. Statistics are gathered on the target registration error (TRE), which is the distance between the original point c and its corresponding point c". RESULTS: This article presents statistics on the TRE calculated for each registration technique in this study and provides a brief description of each technique and an estimate of both preparation and execution time needed to perform the registration. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that retrospective techniques have the potential to produce satisfactory results much of the time, but that visual inspection is necessary to guard against large errors.

Despite the large interest in simulators of minimally invasive surgery, it is still unclear to what extent simulators can achieve the task of training medical students in surgical procedures. The answer to that question is certainly linked to the realism of displays and force-feedback systems and to the level of interaction provided by the computer system. In this paper, we describe the virtual environment for anatomical and surgical training on the liver, currently under construction at INRIA. We specifically address the problems of geometric representation and physical modeling and their impact on the two aforementioned problems: realism and real-time interaction.

The delineation of anatomical structures based on images of the lower abdomen in the frame of dose calculation for conformational radiotherapy is very complex to automatize. We present here the first results of a semi-automatic delineation of the bladder in tomodensitometric (CT) images. The method we have used is based on deformable templates whose deformation is guided by the image and by the user as well, in case the latter desires to correct the automatic delineation. In order to validate our approach, we use a set of CT images that have been segmented by medical experts. These hand-made contours act in fact as "ground truth", allowing for an objective evaluation of the performance of our algorithm.

We present a complete and fully automatic method to compute a tomographic 4D representation of coronary arteries from one single rotational monoplane X-ray sequence. The major steps of our method are the following: (1) images filtering, (2) arteries segmentation, (3) arteries matching and reconstruction, (4) parametric deformation field computation, and (5) deformation-compensated tomographic reconstruction. Steps (2) and (3) involve only a few frames, acquired at the same cardiac cycle phase, while the steps (1), (4), and (5) use the frames acquired at all cardiac cycle phases. This method has been successfully applied to 4 patient data sets. The 4D representation allows the visualization of coronary arteries anatomy from any point of view, and at any cardiac cycle time.

This article addresses the problem of histogram matching in the context of medical image processing. Such a problem occurs while comparing two images of the same object, where intensity differences are due to different acquisition conditions. This can be compensated by histogram matching or equalization. To achieve this, we based our method on windowing techniques. This allows to match implicitly continuous probability density functions, yielding more robust results than the methods issued from discrete histograms.

The skeleton and its associated medial axis give a very compact representation of objects, even in the case of complex shapes and topologies. They are powerful shape descriptors, bridging the gap between low-level and highlevel object representations. Surprisingly, skeletons have been used in a relatively small number of applications. This work deals with the question of using the potential strength of the skeleton and the medial axis. From the medial axis, we build adequate attributed relational graphs to organize in a structured way informations about object shape and topology contained in the medial axis. This representation then permits to compare in a meaningful way various objects using a graph matching algorithm. Synthetic results are presented.

The study of cerebral micro-vascular network requires high resolution images. However, to obtain statistically relevant results, a large area of the brain (about few square millimeters) has to be investigated. This leads us to consider huge images, too large to be loaded and processed at once in the memory of a standard computer. To consider a large area, a compact representation of the vessels is required. The medial axis seems to be the tools of choice for the aimed application. To extract it, a dedicated skeletonization algorithm is proposed. Indeed, a skeleton must be homotopic, thin and medial with respect to the object it represents. Numerous approaches already exist which focus on computational efficiency. However, they all implicitly assume that the image can be completely processed in the computer memory, which is not realistic with the size of the data considered here. We present in this paper a skeletonization algorithm that processes data locally (in sub-images) while preserving global properties (i.e. homotopy). We then show some results obtained on a mosaic of 3-D images acquired by confocal microscopy.

This report describes the calculation of local errors in Chamfer masks both in two- and in three-dimensional anisotropic spaces. For these errors, closed forms are given that can be related to the Chamfer mask geometry. Thanks to these calculation, it can be obsrved that the usual Chamfer masks ({\em i.e.} 3x3x3 or 5x5x5) have an inhomogeneously distributed error. Moreover, it allows us to design dedicated Chamfer masks by controlling either the complexity of the computation of the distance map (or equivalently the number of vectors in the mask), or the error of the mask in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ or in $\mathbb{Z}^3$. Last, since Chamfer distances are usually computed with integer weights (and approximate the Euclidean distance up to a multiplicative factor), we demonstrate that the knowledge of the local errors allows a very efficient computation of these weights.

Chamfer distances are widely used in image analysis, and many ways have been investigated to compute optimal chamfer mask coefficients. Unfortunately, these methods are not systematized: they have to be conducted manually for every mask size or image anisotropy. Since image acquisistion (e.g. medical imaging) can lead to anisotropic discrete grids with unpredictable anisotropy value, automated calculation of chamfer mask coefficients becomes mandatory for efficient distance map computation. This report presentes a systematized calculation of these coefficients based on the automatic construction of chamfer masks of any size associated with a triangulation that allows to derive analytically the relative error with respect to the Euclidean distance, in any 3-D anisotropic lattice and that also allows to compute norm constraints.

This report tackles the registration of 2D biological images (histological sections or autoradiographs) to 2D images from the same or different modalities (e.g., histology or MRI). The process of acquiring these images typically induces composite transformations that we model as a number of rigid or affine local transformations embedded in an elastic one. We propose a registration approach closely derived from this model. Given a pair of input images, we first compute a dense similarity field between them with a block matching algorithm. A hierarchical clustering algorithm then automatically partitions this field into a number of classes from which we extract independent pairs of sub-images. Our clustering algorithm relies on the Earth mover's distribution metric and is additionally guided by robust least-square estimation of the transformations associated with each cluster. Finally, the pairs of sub-images are, independently, affinely registered and a hybrid affine/non-linear interpolation scheme is used to compose the output registered image. We investigate the behavior of our approach under a variety of conditions, and discuss examples using simulated and real medical images, including MRI, autoradiography, histology and cryosection data. We also detail the reconstruction of a 3-D volume from a series of 2-D histological sections and compare it against a reconstruction obtained with a global rigid approach.

Among the main research themes of the team, one can find the extraction of quantitative parameters (shape, texture) from images, image registration (temporal, multimodal, multi-subject...), the construction of anatomical and functional atlases from images, morphometry (statistics on shape and intensities), the analysis of the cardiac motion, the modeling of soft tissues for visual and haptic interaction, physiological models of organs, and the coupling of medical imaging and robotics.

In the present report, we propose a new model to simulate the growth of glioblastomas multiforma (GBM), the most aggressive glial tumors. Because the GBM shows a preferential growth in the white fibers and have a distinct invasion speed with respect to the nature of the invaded tissue, we rely on an anatomical atlas to introduce this information into the model. This atlas includes a white fibers diffusion tensor information and the delineation of cerebral structures having a distinct response to the tumor aggression. We use the finite element method (FEM) to simulate both the invasion of the GBM in the brain parenchyma and its mechanical interaction (mass effect) with the invaded structures. The former effect is modeled with either a reaction-diffusion or a Gompertz equation depending on the considered tissue, while the latter is based on a linear elastic brain constitutive equation. In addition, we propose a new coupling equation taking into account the mechanical influence of the tumor cells on the invaded tissues. This tumor growth model is assessed by comparing the in-silico GBM growth with the real GBM growth observed between two magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a patient acquired with six months difference. The quality of the results shows the feasibility of modeling the complex behavior of brain tumors and will justify a further validation of this new conceptual approach.

The explosive growth in brain imaging technologies (such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI) has only been matched by a tremendous increase in the number of investigations focusing on the structural and functional organization of the human brain. However, the formidable complexity and variability of cerebral structures present a substantial challenge to their effective analysis and modelisation, and require the conjunction of a number of techniques drawn from a large panel of scientific domains: computer vision, image analysis or statitical modeling to name just a few.

A natural way to condense, analyse and communicate brain data, digital brain atlases consequently stem from the combination of many algorithms whose underlying hypotheses must be validated a posteriori.

The INRIA EPIDAURE team focuses on the design and development of tools adapted to the analysis of multidimensional and multimodal medical images, with the aim to enhance the available diagnosis. A non-exhaustive selection of the main research axes would encompass the extraction of quantitative parameters for automated/aided diagnosis (shape, texture, displacement), the spatial and temporal registration of 2-D and 3-D medical images, multimodal image fusion problems, the analysis of deformable displacements, or the design and manipulation of digital atlases with, in the longer run, the goal to automate the morphometric and functional analysis of the brain.

The association of both teams within this program enables a better factorisation of the experience and knowledge they have both acquired, and permit to jointly tackle the restauration, segmentation or image registration issues that the development of digital brain atlases invariably raises.

Prior to this project, several informal collaborations took place between the two teams, like the evaluation of an histological slices registration method developped at Epidaure thanks to an atlas of a rat brain acquired at the LONI, or the participation of Epidaure to the redaction of of the "brain warping" book editer by A. Toga on digital techniques for the analysis of the human brain.

During the first three years of this joint-team project, the PhD thesis of Alain Pitiot, jointly supervised by N. Ayache and P. Thompson, strengthened the scientific exchanges between the two teams. This thesis was devoted to the segmentation of anatomical structures of the brain for the creation of atlases, and was successfully defended on November 26, 2003. Since then, Vincent Arsigny and Pierre Fillard dedicate part of their PhD to the study of the brain variability using the massive database of images and delineated cerebral structures acquired by P. Thompson at the LONI.

The constitution of EPIDAURE and LONI as associated teams brings a formal framework to an already existing collaboration with concrete projects and the joint supervision of PhD students. EPIDAURE's strength principally resides in the methodological expertise developped for the robust analysis of medical images, while the strength of the LONI lies in the experiences accumulated through multiple international collaborations on the development of brain atlases (e.g. the Human Brain Mapping project) and the amount of data and knowledge acquired to validate these methods.

This collaboration allows to factor the image analysis algorithms and the clinical databases of a sufficient size (typically several hundreds of images) need to validate them, in order to develop more robust and more accurate brain atlases.

Thanks to the combined power of the databases sizes and the precision of the image analysis algorithms, we expect to be able to infer new hypotheses about the underlying structural organization of the brain.

One task of this project consist in designing a robot able to perform surgical gestures on a beating heart. To this end it is necessary to model the local cardiac motion in order to optimize the control of the robotics device.

H. Delingette and J-M. Peyrat have visited the research group of Eliott Mc Veigh on Monday June 12th in Bethesda near Washington DC. They have presented the current research activity of CardioSense3D, focusing on the structural analysis of cardiac fiber orientation and electrophysiology modeling. The join work between Asclepios and the NIH laboratory have been published in one conference and one IEEE paper.

A paper first authored by J-M Peyrat on the creation of a statistical atlas of diffusion tensor images of canine hearts  will appear in the conference MICCAI, the main conference on medical image analysis.

Nicholas Ayache has presented an overview of the research pursued  at Asclepios team in front of several members of the French academy of science during a symposium organized in Nice and Sophia-Antipolis. The presentation included the past and current results of the CardioSense3D national action.

M. Sorine et M. Fernandez have attended this symposium. M.A. Fernandez has taught a course entitled " Numerical simulations of the fluid-structure coupling in physiological vessels " and M. Sorine has presented a scientific communication entitled " Multi-scale modelling of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and applications".

That meeting was split between a morning session on purely scientific issues with the first circle of partners and an afternoon session on clinical application with several members of the second circle. More than 20 participants have attended this meeting.

This is the third edition of that conference that focuses on the topic of cardiac modeling. N. Ayache, H. Delingette, D. Chapelle, V. Moreau, Ph. Moireau and Maxime Sermesant have attended this conference.

Presentation of 2 scientific articles at that conference. The first article defines a new methodology to estimate the appearent electrical conductivity of the endocardium from experimental electrophysiological data. The second article describes a first attempt to estimate tissue contractility from motion estimation of the myocardium.

We propose a bio-inspired spiking V1 model that transforms a video sequence into spike trains according to local motion detectors. The motion detectors are directionally spatial-temporal filters properly tuned for a certain range of velocity. At the same time we propose a method to obtain a histogram map representation for the velocity distribution of V1 output. This histogram map acts as a MT-like model containing the spatial-temporal information of an event. We also propose a distance between histogram maps to realize motion categorization.

Our MT-like model proposed consists on a spatial-temporal velocity structure representation of a sequence. For this we divide each input frame into Nv neighborhoods of the same size. For each neighborhood the number of cells activated for each velocity is stored.

Secondly, a classical block design substraction procedure was completed to reveal the hMT+ complex, contrasting random dots pattern in coherent motion with a dynamic noise or a static condition [3]. For the fMRI runs, EPI sequence was used to image each 2111ms 20 pseudo-coronal slices starting from the occipital pole to get the retinotopic visual areas and extending rostrally to include hMT+. The resulting voxel resolution is 2x2x2 mm3. Data were analyzed with SPM's General Linear Model (3 mm gaussian kernel). During the functional images acquisition, attention and fixation were controlled through a discrimination task at the fixation cross.

For fiber tracking analysis, diffusion tensors were used as a metric to first compute the geodesic distance and then the shortest paths between the above stated areas of the visual cortex, as described in [4]. A measure of likelihood for each computed path was derived by examining the properties of the geodesic distance function.

Images were realigned and coregistered on the subject high resolution anatomical scan acquired within the scanning session after its normalization in the standard Talairach template. The results are analyzed on this anatomical image or a cortical surface model extracted from the latter using the Brainvisa software [5].

We found various connections between areas of the occipital and mid-temporal cortex, in line with previous results in non-human primates. Our results show a good intra and inter-subject reproducibility.

Beyond the validation of merging fMRI mappings and DTI connectivity informations, this study improves our confidence in the areas labelling and further brings insights about the famous ventral and dorsal streams in the human low level visual cortex.

It is well known that fMRI data have low SNR. In order to increase the signal of interest, a spatial smoothing procedure is commonly used. The smoothness of the data is also assumed in Gaussian Random Field theory used in the SPM analysis. However, this smoothing is usually 3D-isotropic, thus mixing voxels from different anatomical tissues (e.g. gray matter, white matter and CSF). This leads to undesirable averaging of signals at neighboring voxels, potentially affecting the analysis sensitivity. Furthermore, due to the highly convoluted geometry of the cortex, the "tissue-blindness" of this smoothing yields a mixing of signals across sulci at voxels close to each other in the volume but distant on the cortical surface, reducing further the spatial discrimination power [1]. Taking into account the cortical geometry in the smoothing process seems to be a natural way to avoid these drawbacks.

We implemented and compared two algorithms for surface-based smoothing, one based on an explicit mesh scheme and the other on a level-set framework. Both aim at minimizing the variations of the values defined along the cortical surface, leading to a partial differential equation (PDE) involving the Laplace-Beltrami operator, as shown respectively in [2] and [3]. The equivalent gaussian kernel FWHM is easily linked to the equation running time. Our cortical surface meshes are obtained with masks extracted with the Brainvisa software [4] and a segmentation algorithm based on the level-set evolution framework.

The mesh-based approach starts with a projection of the cortical functional voxels on the cortical surface and, after smoothing, performs a "back projection" into the original volume. This enables the direct use of the classical functional data analysis tools, but restricts the projection technique to the nearest neighbor method.

The level-set approach relies on the computation of a distance function, a 3D volume of the Euclidian distance from the cortical surface mesh. The PDE is then solved in a band around the cortical sheet directly in the functional volumes.

Finally, a formula is derived to adapt the threshold value for a T-test, taking into account the cortical surface area. This allows us to compare the results of both methods with the standard volumetric SPM-smoothing at equivalent p-value, on synthetic and real fMRI datasets related to visual perception experiments.

Surface-based smoothing provides better sensitivity in activation detection, leading to higher statistical values. It furthermore enhances their spatial localization and discrimination. According to our algorithms, the level set approach seems more straightforward and more easily adaptable to any functional data analysis framework.

Delineating the cortical visual areas is a calibration experiment for any study of the human cortical visual system. The retinotopic mapping process is based on a phase-encoded analysis. Beyond estimating the areas borders, it provides information linking the actual visual field and the cortical surface. We describe the full structure of our method and some of the comparisons we have made between competing options in order to optimize the results: stimuli design, functional data processing and anatomical data processing.

The method we describe derives from previous work [1], [2]. It is fast, the whole retinotopic map being acquired in about 15 mn of functional acquisition, semi-automatic and shows an excellent reproducibility, intra-subject but also inter-subject, the same patterns being found on different subjects. The stimuli were a wedge, coding for angular maps and a ring, coding for eccentricity maps. The functional analysis scheme is based on a frequency analysis, which allows a continuous and accurate response phase estimation, hence an accurate information. Additionally, no more hypothesis on the hemodynamic response is required than its linearity with respect to the stimulation. The main steps of the functional analysis are the computation of a statistical map to determine, by thresholding, the voxels activated by our stimuli, followed by a phase estimation, including a voxel-based hemodynamic delay estimation. The results are then projected on the cortical surface. The area borders are assessed using the Visual Field Sign differenciation. We have performed different tests and comparisons of various elements of the complete process. We first compare the results obtained with a stimulation of 4 complete rotations versus 8, which leads to the conclusion that our method provides consistent estimates even with low SNR. Results with the usual single wedge versus a symetrical wedge are also compared, the former one being the most efficient. The results of four different preprocessing methods of the functional data sets are evaluated: motion correction, slice-timing, smoothing and none. We also compare two different methods for processing the anatomical data (starting from brain segmentation to the visualisation of the functional maps on an inflated cortical surface, including the surface-based computation of the area borders). The first method derives from information theory and scale-space analysis [3], using the Brainvisa software; the second one is based on a level-set framework developed at the Odyssee lab. [4]. Thanks to these comparisons and tests we have been able to design a close to optimal method for acquiring robust individual retinotopic maps.

We propose an efficient method, enabling a fast, accurate and reproducible delineation of the retinotopic visual areas of a subject from MR data. The tools we have developed will help improve further studies of the human visual cortex, taking into account this fast retinotopic labelling.

Most of our understanding of the human visual system comes from comparison with experimental data, especially single-cell data, obtained in monkeys. The problem has been that one has to compare results obtained not only in different species but also with different techniques. A considerable advance could be made if one could compare the functional imaging results in human to those obtained with the same technique in monkeys and then in a second step compare within the same species functional imaging data with single-cell or other experimental data. To that end one needs functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the awake, behaving monkey.

The overall aim is to perfect the monkey fMRI technique already in place in order to compare different types of fMRI analysis with an existing metabolic mapping standard in the monkey and to compare directly cortical networks in human and non human primates. We will use fMRI to map visual cortical regions responsive to different types of visual stimuli and active in visual discrimination tasks in monkeys and in humans. We will within the same monkey subject compare activation maps measured with fMRI and those obtained by metabolic labeling (double label 2deoxyglucose - 2DG). This latter data will serve as ''ground truth'' with which to compare the results of the different analysis techniques for the fMRI signals. We will also use ICA to develop new tools to estimate functional connectivity and compare this to the extensive anatomical knowledge available in the monkey.

We are interested in PDE-based approaches for vector-valued image regularization, and its applications for a wide class of interesting image processing problems. The comparative study of existing methods allows us to propose a common mathematical framework, better adapted to understand the underlying diffusion geometry of the regularization processes, as well as design corresponding numerical schemes. Thus we develop a new multivalued image regularization approach that verifies important geometric properties. It can be used in a large range of regularization-related applications. We also tackle the problem of constrained regularization and propose a specific variational formalism unifying in a common framework, the equations acting on direction features : unit vectors, rotation matrices, diffusion tensors, etc. Proposed solutions are analyzed and used with success to solve applications of interest, such as color image regularization and interpolation, flow visualization, regularization of rigid motions estimated from video sequences, and aided reconstruction of coherent fibers network models in the white matter of the~brain, using DT-MRI imaging.

We propose to use approximations of shape metrics such as the Hausdorff distance to define similarity measures between shapes. Our approximations being continuous and differentiable, they provide an obvious way to warp a shape onto another by solving a Partial Differential Equation (PDE), in effect a curve flow, obtained from their first order variation.

This first order variation defines a normal deformation field for a given curve. We use the normal deformation fields induced by several sample shape examples to define their mean, their covariance "operator", and the principal modes of variation. Our theory, which can be seen as a nonlinear generalization of the linear approaches proposed by several authors, is illustrated with numerous examples. Our approach being based upon the use of distance functions is characterized by the fact that it is intrinsic, i.e. independent of the shape parametrization.

We present a method for nonlinear diffusion of matrix-valued data. We adapt this technique to the well-known structure tensor in order to develop a new nonlinear structure tensor. It is then used to improve the optic flow estimation methods of Lucas and Kanade and its spatio-temporal variant of Bigun et al.. Our experiments show that the nonlinear structure tensor leads to a better preservation of discontinuities in the optic flow field. This was a talk at the DAGM 2002 in Zurich about the topic of my diploma thesis. I will also add a few words about recent results.

Automatically understanding human behavior from video sequences is a very challenging problem. This involves 'extraction' of relevant visual information from a video sequence, 'representation' of that information in a suitable form, and 'interpretation' of visual information for the purpose of recognition and learning human behavior. In this talk, first we will present our approach for tracking people in multiple cameras. We employ the novel approach of finding the limits of field of view (FOV) of a camera as visible in the other cameras. Using this information, when a person is seen in one camera, we are able to predict all the other cameras in which this person will be visible. Moreover, we apply the FOV constraint to disambiguate between possible candidates for correspondence. Tracking in each individual camera needs to be resolved before such an analysis can be applied. We perform tracking in a single camera using background subtraction, followed by region correspondence. This takes into account the velocities, sizes and distance of bounding boxes obtained through connected component labeling. In the second part of the talk, we will discuss automatically understanding human actions using motion trajectories derived from video sequences. Since an action takes place in 3-D, and is projected on 2-D image, depending on the viewpoint of the camera the projected 2-D trajectory may vary. This may create a problem in interpretation of trajectories at the higher level. However, if the representation of actions only captures characteristics, which are view-invariant, then the higher level interpretation can proceed without any ambiguity. We will discuss a computational representation of human action to capture dramatic changes in a motion trajectory using spatio-temporal curvature of 2-D trajectory. This representation is compact, view-invariant, and is capable of explaining an action in terms of meaningful atomic units.

In few cases in image processing and vision it is necessary that the denoising process commutes with a certain Lie group. We will describe the known solution for the equi-affine flow for a curve in R^2 as a prototype. In order to generalize to other cases, we reformulate the problem via the Beltrami framework and re-derive the solution for the hyperplane (codim=1) case and then show how to generalize to the codim >1 cases. In particular we present a new equi-affine invariant floe for a curve in R^3.

Stuff. I would love to chat with anyone doing structure from motion, robots, augmented reality who is interested in chatting with me. If anyone is interested in visiting Georgia Tech for a couple of months after the summer, then they can talk to me also and it can probably be arranged.

In recent years, because cameras have become inexpensive and ever more prevalent, there has been increasing interest in modeling human shape and motion from image data. Such an ability has many applications, such as electronic publishing, entertainment, sports medicine and athletic training. This, however, is an inherently difficult task, both because the body is very complex and because the data that can be extracted from images is often incomplete, noisy and ambiguous.

In this talk, I will present the approach we have developed to overcome these difficulties. We start from sophisticated 3-D animation models and reformulate them so that they can be used for data analysis. We use them, not only to represent faces and bodies in motion, but also to guide the interpretation of the image data, thereby substantially improving performance. Using complex video sequences, I will highlight the effectiveness of our approach to video-based shape and motion capture and demonstrate the applicability of our technology for Augmented Reality purposes. Finally, I will present some open research issues and discuss our plans for future developments.

Between neuroscience and mathematical modeling, we explore visual representations using brief elementar events, or spikes. In particular, we are interested in optimizing the representations by using a relatively low number of spikes and show how the chosen strategy leads to a efficient visual code. We propose then a plausible neuronal implementation of processing but also of learning which leads to results similar as those observed in the primary visual area.

The nature of the signal distribution of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data is subject to discussion: many state it is Gaussian, some claim it is only slightly non-Gaussian, while others state that the distribution is Gamma-like. In combination with studies exploring the nonlinearity of fMRI time series, the non-parametric approach becomes favourable over the Gaussian one for performing fMRI analyses. Moreover, using the non-parametric approach, some filtering operations performed to obtain a Gaussian distribution, can be omitted leaving the signal space as original as possible while maintaining the validity of the analysis. In a first stage we use a Data Modeller that uses theorems from the field of nonlinear state dynamics to retain a small couple of voxels, the timeseries of which display together the same temporal structure as the whole fMRI data set. As such a considerable reduction of the search space can be performed and the remaining timeseries can be considered as prototypes. Starting from these prototypes, one can outline brain regions showing a coherent temporal behaviour although they could be spatially distinct. Once the possibly interesting voxels are selected, the statistical processing can be started to elect those voxels that respond in a significant way to the used paradigm (the sequence of stimuli one wants to investigate). To account for the non-Gaussian nature of the data nonparametric statistic tests like the Cramer-von Mises or the Mann-Whitney test are used as tools for the detection of the foci of activation. These tests are not only guaranteed to be more valid, but offer also more sensitivity and an increased robustness against possible parameter variations. Since no smoothing is used in the earlier Data Modeller stage, alternative methods are applied to correct for the multiple comparison problem. We have chosen for the False Discovery Rate. In general the results found with our tool do no differ that much with current analyses software packages, but the found results show an increased degree of detail ---since no smoothing has been applied--- and smaller foci of activations can be detected as well due to the absence of smoothing and the increased sensitivity of the used statistical tests.

An algorithm for computing intrinsic distance functions and geodesics on sub-manifolds of \R^d given by point clouds is introduced in this paper. The basic idea is that, as shown in this paper, intrinsic distance functions and geodesics on general co-dimension sub-manifolds of \R^d can be accurately approximated by the extrinsic Euclidean ones computed in a thin offset band surrounding the manifold. This permits the use of computationally optimal algorithms for computing distance functions in Cartesian grids. We then use these algorithms, modified to deal with spaces with boundaries, and obtain also for the case of intrinsic distance functions on sub-manifolds of \R^d, a computationally optimal approach. For point clouds, the offset band is constructed without the need to explicitly find the underlying manifold, thereby computing intrinsic distance functions and geodesics on point clouds while skipping the manifold reconstruction step. The case of point clouds representing noisy samples of a sub-manifold of Euclidean space is studied as well. All the underlying theoretical results are presented, together with experimental examples, and comparisons to graph-based distance algorithms.

A method for building statistical point distribution models is proposed. The novelty in this paper is the adaption of Markov random field regularization of the correspondence field over the set of shapes. The new approach leads to a generative model that produces highly homogeneous polygonized shapes and improves the capability of reconstruction of the training data.

Furthermore, the method leads to an overall reduction in the total variance of the point distribution model. Thus, it finds correspondence between semi-landmarks that are highly correlated in the shape tangent space. The method is demonstrated on a set of human ear canals extracted from 3D-laser scans. First presented at "Information Processing in Medical Imaging 2003", Ambleside, UK.

We recently introduced a method -- termed Helmholtz stereopsis -- for reconstructing the geometry of objects from a collection of images. Unlike most existing methods for surface reconstruction (e.g., stereo, structure from motion, photometric stereo), Helmholtz stereopsis does not assume a model of surface reflectance. The idea behind the method is quite simple: we choose pairs of light source and camera positions in order to take advantage of the symmetry of surface reflectance. In this talk, I will discuss the relationship between Helmholtz stereo and existing reconstruction techniques such as structure from motion and photometric stereo, and I will show that it has some important advantages for certain applications. I will also present recent extensions that include uncalibrated reconstruction and reconstruction from two views.

An new paradigm for computing intrinsic distance functions and geodesics on sub-manifolds of $\R^d$ given by point clouds is introduced in this paper. The basic idea is that, as shown here, intrinsic distance functions and geodesics on general co-dimension sub-manifolds of $\R^d$ can be accurately approximated by extrinsic Euclidean ones computed inside a thin offset band surrounding the manifold. This permits the use of computationally optimal algorithms for computing distance functions in Cartesian grids. We use these algorithms, modified to deal with spaces with boundaries, and obtain also for the case of intrinsic distance functions on sub-manifolds of $\R^d$, a computationally optimal approach. For point clouds, the offset band is constructed without the need to explicitly find the underlying manifold, thereby computing intrinsic distance functions and geodesics on point clouds while skipping the manifold reconstruction step. The case of point clouds representing noisy samples of a sub-manifold of Euclidean space is studied as well. All the underlying theoretical results are presented along with experimental examples for diverse applications and comparisons to graph-based distance algorithms. Joint work with F. Memoli.

Humans looking around in the world can, seemingly without effort, segment out and distinguish different objects in the world. The corresponding capability has largely eluded the efforts of researchers in computer vision. The problem is of course not well-defined unless additional assumptions are made. If we ask ourselves what objects we see around us we realize that such a question has little meaning and is too imprecise to answer. We need at least a model of the visual observer and the tasks this observer is engaged in to specify what these objects could be. They are not given by the visual scene alone. The processes of perceiving objects in the world and segmenting images of them depend on each other and figure-ground segmentation is generally not feasible solely bottom-up. Whatever the processes are they should be possible to bootstrap in some way and a question is what such mechanisms could be. Work in perceptual grouping and attention address some such aspects. Here we'll discuss the use of 3D cues for figure-ground separation. If something stands out in 3D, then it forms a separate piece of materia and as such it is more than something that just stands out visually as, say, a set of contours, surface markings or colored patches. Such visual patterns may indicate objects or groups of objects in a multitude of ways. Unless we know more about the scene it is difficult to say if they define any relevant objects. On the other hand, even without such knowledge, we can identify a 3D chunk as "something", which then can be ascribed visually observable 3D properties, such as position, location and motion, but also object intrinsic properties such as shape, color and maybe surface and material characteristics. One thing the 3D cues tell us is the geometric relation between the observer and the object. The identity of a (not necessarily recognized or labeled) object can also be maintained over time by the appearance of the object, i.e. properties such as shape and color that can be obtained from the 2D images. This strongly suggests that a system for robust figure-ground segmentation in a dynamically changing world should rely on mutiple cues in 3D and 2D and that the 3D cues play a specific role in the bootstrapping. This forms a main theme of the talk. In it we will discuss some of the underlying issues and illustrate them with examples from our own work. We will discuss figure-ground segmentation based on stereo and motion cues together with monocular cues from e.g. texture. We will also discuss the combination of purely monocular cues from motion, color and contrast, considering several different integration techniques allowing learning appearance models of the segmented objects.

Based on recent works in robust parameter estimation, we propose to use an orthogonal least-square estimator along with the Mahalanobis distance instead of the Euclidean norm. It allows to take into consideration the heteroscedastic noise properties of the measurements and it removes the large bias in the solution. In addition we present a general modeling of direct methods. We have removed the brightness constancy constraint to benefit from more complex similarity metrics such as the cross-correlation criterion, using recent work in non-rigid registration as a basis.

Joint work with Haifeng Chen and David Tyler. To exhibit a robust behavior, data analysis techniques incorporate a priori information into the procedure. Most often this information is related to the largest tolerable scale of the inlier noise, or equivalently, to the smallest percentage of inliers. The success of the analysis is contingent upon the correctness of the assumptions. We show that all the robust regression techniques popular in computer vision are special cases of the general class of M-estimators with auxiliary scale.

Next, we reinterpret M-estimation within the projection pursuit framework, and describe a new robust regression technique whose performance is much less conditioned on the accuracy of additional information. Affine motion and fundamental matrix estimation, from data in which the percentage of outliers significantly exceeds that of inliers, are used as examples. Time permitting, we will also discuss the issue of data containing multiple structures. Related papers PETER MEER received the Dipl. Engn. degree from the Bucharest Polytechnic Institute, Bucharest, Romania, and the D.Sc. degree from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, both in electrical engineering.

In the last decades there have been a widespread interest in the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) in many different problems ranging from pattern classification to control engineering. A very important and widely applicable class of ANN models are the feedforward artificial neural networks (FANN) because they have been remarked as universal approximators of nonlinear functions that can be trained from examples of input-output data. The learning algorithm for the parameters estimation of the neural model relies on the data. When the data are contaminated with outliers, i.e. observations that are substantially different to the bulk of data due to gross errors or deviations of the distributional assumptions, they can influence badly bringing degradation in the estimates. Full efficiency can be achieved only when the data agree with the assumptions underlying the data generating process but not when deviations from them occurs, aspect widely investigated in statistics but very poorly in the ANN literature. By relaxing some assumptions about the intuition of the noise distribution corrupting the data measurements to a neighborhood of the unknown distribution, we characterize the networks as "semiparametric". We seek a compromise in terms of statistical efficiency and robustness of learning procedures by applying M estimators introduced by Huber as a generalization of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), and by analyzing the influence function of the estimates for the FANN model. Some simulation results in Time Series modeling and a comparitive analysis based on the performance of the different learning algorithms is made.

New image modalities, such as DT-MRI, require the development of new algorithms and signal processing techniques different from those already developed for scalar and vector-valued images. In this seminar, after introducing the Center for Technology in Medicine (University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain), we show our contributions to this emerging field, concerning mainly anisotropic filtering and interpolation, as well as a phase-invariant local structure tensor.

Automatic detection and selection of regions of interest is a key step in image understanding. A flowering of studies has been dedicated to this issue during the past decades. Efficient and robust algorithms have been developed for many applications. However, most of them make use of heuristics inherent to a particular class of images. The limiting factor to obtain a general algorithm is the large variety of cues available to characterize a region of interest. It can be gray-level, color, texture, shape, etc... In this thesis, we propose a general formulation able to deal with each one of these characteristics. Image intensity, color, texture, motion and prior shape knowledge are considered. For this purpose, a probabilistic inference is obtained from a Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem.

Then, reformulated as an energy minimization, the most probable image partition is obtained using front evolution techniques. Level-set functions are naturally introduced to represent the evolving fronts while region statistics are optimized in parallel. This framework can naturally handle scalar and vector-valued smooth images but more complex cues are also integrated. Texture and motion features, as well as prior shape knowledge are successively introduced. Complex medical images are considered in the last part with the case of diffusion magnetic resonance images which gives 3D probability density fields.

Although various solutions exist for solving the recognition problem on common datasets, all these datasets have limitations that lower their complexity and make them differ from the idea of being really generic. Focusing on the generic case means considering datasets containing images with highly cluttered background showing various arbitrary instances of the object category. This addresses one of the main problems faced by a visual categorization or recognition system: the difficulty of high intra class variability and the need of generalization across variations in the appearances of objects of the same category. I will presents a powerful framework for generic object recognition. In contrast to previous solutions we aim at handling of complex objects appearing in highly cluttered images. Boosting is used as an underlying learning technique. Besides applying well known techniques to extract salient regions we also present a new segmentation method - ``Similarity-Measure Segmentation''. This approach may deliver segments, which may consist of several disconnected parts. This turns out to be a powerful description of local similarity. We have set up a database containing images with the required complexity. On these images we obtained very good classification results of up to 87 percent. On common databases for object recognition our approach outperforms all comparable solutions.

Landmark matching is a multidimensional interpolation problem in which a dense deformation has to be estimated from the knowledge of a finite number of point correspondences. This relates to spline interpolation, but with the fundamental additional constraint that the final deformation should be a diffeomorphism. In this talk, we review recent developments of this theory. We first describe pure interpolation algorithms, in which point matches are known exactly, and the problem reduces to finding the smoothest diffeomorphism which satisfies the constraints. We then review methods in which point matchings are not given, and more precisely describe two new approaches, one based on quanta estimation and the second on methods for comparing generalized functions.

Point clouds are one of the most primitive and fundamental surface representations. A popular source of point clouds are three dimensional shape acquisition devices such as laser range scanners. Another important field where point clouds are found is in the representation of high-dimensional manifolds by samples. With the increas-ing popularity and very broad applications of this source of data, it is natural and important to work directly with this representation, without having to go to the intermediate and sometimes impossible and distorting steps of surface reconstruction. A geometric framework for comparing manifolds given by point clouds is presented in this paper. The underlying theory is based on Gromov-Hausdorff distances, leading to isometry invariant and completely geometric comparisons. This theory is embedded in a probabilistic setting as derived from random sampling of manifolds, and then combined with results on matrices of pairwise geodesic distances to lead to a computational implementation of the framework. The theoretical and computational results here presented are complemented with experiments for real three dimensional shapes.

We present a discrete-event based approach for the modelling and simulation of large networks of spiking neurons. Discrete-event systems are well adapted to describe the short stereotyped impulses produced by the biological neurons. Besides, they permit a clean modelling of many additional neuronal mechanisms that are known to play an important role in the dynamics of the neurons and networks. We present a modelling approach based on an existing formalism (DEVS : Discrete EVent system Specification), as well as an associated software simulator.

The recently fully acknowledged role of emotions in human communication and decision-making has motivated a new field of investigation within Computer Science - Affective Computing - which aims at rendering digital artifacts aware of human emotions and able to express emotions for enhanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC), as well as endowing them with some of the functionalities of the human emotional system for increased autonomy and ability to deal with uncertainty. In this talk, we describe how physiological signals expressed during emotional arousal are processed and categorized according to various emotional dimensions in order to render Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) more natural and efficient.

Furthermore we describe how, the functional role of emotions in decision-making is modeled using a three-layered architecture for enhanced autonomy of artificial intelligent agents, from software to robotics.

Segmentation of the aorta in 3D Ultrasound images would provide invaluable information for fast non-invasive and low cost diagnosis. Standard methods based on local information like thresholding, region growing or active contours fail in separating the arteries from the veins and suffer from the lack of homogeneity of the vessel intensity and from the partial contour information. We propose to use a model-based multiscale detection of the vessels centerlines based on a cylindrical model with circular cross-section, and adapted from previous work. Our method provides a set of centerlines and an estimate of the vessel radii along each line.

After an interactive selection of the desired lines, a first model of the aorta is generated using the radii information. This model is then locally improved using a level set technique in order to stick to the contours of the image and to allow non-circular cross-section. In order to assess the result, the ultrasound image is manually registered to a Computed Tomography, used as a gold standard.

One of the main tasks of a visual system is computing the shape of objects. A number of cues, notably stereoscopic disparity, texture gradient, motion parallax, contours and shading, have been shown to carry valuable information on surface shape, and have been studied extensively. Unfortunately, many objects of interest and most man-made surfaces, such as a silver plate, a metal spoon or a clean automobile, are smooth and shiny, violating the hypotheses that underlie the analysis of those cues. For specular objects, however one additional cue may be precisely the reflection of the enviroment: a deformed picture of the surrounding scene can be seen on the surface of the specular object and amount and type of deformation depend upon its shape. Our research is aimed at understanding how the human visual system uses this cue in shape perception and what is the relationship relating deformations and local geometry of the surface. To this effect, we assume a simple calibrated scene composed of lines passing through a point (e.g. a checherboard pattern). Under these hypotheses, we demonstrated that local information about the geometry of the surface can be fully recovered up to third order from orientation and local scale of the reflected images of (at least) two intersecting lines.

Both intracellular and extracellular recordings in vivo indicate that the discharge of cortical neurons is highly irregular, consistent with large fluctuations in their synaptic inputs. I will present a theoretical framework based on the Fokker-Planck equation that allowed us to investigate systematically the dynamics of the instantaneous noise. After the discussion of the single neuron dynamics, I will move to the dynamics of large fully connected networks, and then to randomly and sparsely connected networks. Most of the talk will focus on the simplest spiking neuron model, the leaky integrate-and-fire model, but I will also present briefly recent results on more realistic spiking neuron models.

Seeing in the dark: Evidence for functional activity maps in the human visual cortex in the absence of visual input In the last several years we have conducted several fMRI experiments that are characterized by a rather extreme event-related design. In the talk we will describe some of them, and in more details, a recent experiment that aims at exploring activity of the Visual System when no visual stimulus is present. We studied this issue using fMRI in the human visual system, while subjects were placed in complete darkness. Our results reveal wide-spread, slow activation waves during such rest periods. In contrast to stimulus-driven activity, during darkness functionally distinct object areas were activated in unison. This activity became rapidly de-correlated (39 % drop in correlation level, p < 0.008) during visual stimulation. The spontaneous activations showed consistent and specific neuro-anatomical distribution which argued against purely hemodynamic noise sources. Control experiments ruled out eye closure, low luminance and mental imagery as the underlying sources of the spontaneous activity. These results demonstrate that when no-stimulus is present, sensory systems manifest a robust level of slow, organized activation patterns.

Neurons produce their activity (single action potentials and/or repetitive firing) due to recurrent interplay of intrinsic voltage dependent conductances. Thus a neuron may be considered as a complex dynamical system that undergoes input- and state-dependent bifurcations. We shall show that taking such dynamical systems view of neural excitability can lead to a theory of spike generating dynamics based on a classical classification scheme and yielding a simple canonical model. Vast majority of regular firing (non bursting) neurons can be put into two broad classes of excitability. Type II is characterised by non-zero minimal firing frequency, graded action potentials and a presence of sub-threshold resonances. Squid axon is a classical example of such, and the Hodgkin-Huxley model shows such behaviour. Type I membranes are characterized by arbitrarily low firing frequency, all-or-none spikes, and a general absence of resonances. Regular firing pyramidal neurons are an example of this type.

Importantly, the key to further understanding lies in our ability to rescue its plasticity with benzodiazepines. Not only can the timing of the critical period now be shifted freely, but also a detailed local circuit analysis of competitive plasticity in vivo is made possible.

Indeed, it is paradoxical to think how inhibition might enable plasticity in the developing brain. Our identification of specific GABA circuits that drive critical period onset (large basket cells) and the subsequent sequence of anatomical events (spine pruning) allows for the construction of realistic computational models with which to target the plasticity process further. Two scenarios centered on fast-spiking circuits will be discussed. These findings signal a paradigm shift that considers the balance of excitation-inhibition in cortical plasticity with broad potential relevance across brain systems and for translational research into human development.

As part of the presentation we show how to compute distance functions in linear time, being this a critical component non only of our colorization approach but also of many algorithms in shape and imaging.

Information theory has been extensively used to study neural coding in different brain areas.  Measuring mutual information between a stimulus set and the neuron responses allows us to test alternative coding strategies both in single cell and neuron assemblies.  For the sake of example, we present here an application to investigate neurotransmission in the cerebellar granule cell layer with special attention to the mossy fiber-granule cell synaptic relay. This system has a peculiar structure because it is characterized by a limited number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (4 on average), permitting to dissect the noise sources during neurotransmission and to carry out an extensive analysis of the input stimuli.  Our results indicate that the most informative stimuli are usually characterized by high correlation between the four mossy fibers suggesting a role for granule cells in detecting correlation in their afferent signals.

In pluricellular organisms, positional information is necessary to all developmental processes. In the neuroepithelium, for example, positional information regulates the emplacement of territories, the place of borders between these territories, axonal guidance and synapse formation. We want to understand how positional information is generated and how cells respond to this information by the expression of developmental programs. It is well known that morphogens constitute a class of molecules inducing morphogenetic responses to cells and cell ensembles. The concept of morphogen is related to that of positional value, as the generation of morphological and physiological characteristics is function of position. We have developed a mathematical model for morphogenetic gradient formation. The novelty of this model takes its origin in the hypothesis that homeoproteins, a class of transcription factors with morphogenetic functions, traffic from cell to cell and regulate their own expression in a non-cell autonomous manner. We will discuss in particular how morphogens can generate various gradients. The mathematical model is applied to study boundary formation and stability between two adjacent morphogenetic regions.

For example, given the heat flow PDE and known temperatures at fixed (but unknown) sensor node locations, the equations can be reworked so as to determine the sensor locations (i.e., to solve the sensor localization problem). This can be done for a wide variety of initial conditions and depends only on the equations defining the physical process and the specific realization of the process in the world.

The current work attempts to generalize the previous models to non-parametric manifolds. The last part of this talk will present a new 5 dimensional space representation of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) of high angular resolution. The two main advantages of this new MRI representation is to simplify the segmentation of fibers since this space consists of only scalar values and to solve the crossing fibers issue because fibers that cross in the spatial space are clearly distangled in the DW-MRI space. We adapt the standard level set technique to this 5D space to extract fiber tracts in brain images.

Imaging neuroscience describes the functional organization of human brain at the level of large neuronal groupings, networks and systems. A systems level of description addresses how integrated brain functions are embodied in the physical structure of the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now the modality of choice in structural and functional imaging neuroscience. The analysis of structural and functional brain images can nowadays be carried out automatically using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The resultant ability to perform clinical-functional-anatomical correlative studies in life with complete objectivity and unparalleled sensitivity is providing powerful new opportunities for the study of brain pathology and plasticity. One of the most exciting and dramatic observations to come from human brain mapping with a wide range of structural and functional techniques is the dynamic plasticity of function in the brains of patients with strokes. Recent activation studies have provided interesting information about the brain~s capacity to reorganise after such injury and in association with practice and learning that constitute the bedrock of rehabilitation. Though presently in the realm of basic physiology, the study of brain plasticity and its modulation by drugs and other therapies indicates a novel approach to the rehabilitation of stroke damaged adults. Brain maps must be viewed as dynamic, changing with development, disease progression and in the recovery of function after acute injury. The dynamic plasticity of functional brain maps provides an exciting opportunity to study these processes.

Abstract. In this paper we propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compare two quotiented trees using a constrained edit distance. A quotiented tree is a tree defined with an additional equivalent relation on vertices and such that the quotient graph is also a tree. The core of the method relies on an adaptation of an algorithm recently proposed by Zhang for comparing unordered rooted trees. This method is currently being used in plant architecture modelling to quantify different types of variability between plants represented by quotiented trees.

Virtual Multicomputer for Symbolic Applications - which is a network project under the EC's Human Capital and Mobility programme.

The goal is to develop AI applications to run on distributed architectures and across local and wide-area networks.

Project in collaboration with SNCF, Alstom. Developed motion detection and behaviour recognition algorithms for real time video monitoring in trains. Worked in collaboration with a PhD student on program supervision applied to video interpretation.

The scope of the internship is in agreement with the ongoing research of the ORION team. It concerns audio-video event representation for automatic video understanding.The ORION team has developed a video understanding platform capable of recognizing certain behaviors that are predefined by experts and stored in an event model base. The team has also developed a knowledge representation language (called Event Description Language - EDL) that facilitates experts for describing their events of interest. The EDL language has been used by different European and French projects for video surveillance and monitoring; however it does still not conform to standard knowledge representation languages such as OWL.

In addition, the Protege software has been used by a large number of experts in Artificial Intelligence for editing knowledge base. This software expresses an excellent power for editing event models conforming to standard languages.

The objectives of the internship is to adapt the EDL language to standard knowledge representation languages and to use common knowledge editors to build and maintain (co-operative work) event model bases for automatic video understanding systems.

The internship consists of both a theoretical study on knowledge representation and the development of a tool for adapting EDL-based knowledge representation to OWL.The first step will be a deep bibliographic study on the subject. The second step will be a representation of audio-video events in Protege/OWL. The last step will be the development of a tool for converting automatically all knowledge represented in EDL language to OWL and the invert conversion.

When designing a knowledge-based system, the fisrt taks of an expert is to write a representation of his/her knowledge in the given domain. For this purpose we propose a knowledge representation language (expert language) that includes object represeentation and inference rules. It is suitable to provide this language with modern editing facilities: syntax highlighting, completion, syntactic verification on the fly... Once the knowledge base has been written and translated into operational code (in our case in C++), the second task is to test it, for instance using dynamic debugging facilities. Debugging should be performed at the right abstraction level, the expert one, not at the C++ one: error and trace messages should refer to expert language constructs, watch and break points should be put on expert significant objects (when triggering a particular rule, modifying an object attribute...), step by step execution should be performed at expert language statement granularity...

For representing expert knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, one may use dedicated object-oriented languages known as "frame languages". These languages make it possible to describe the objects of the application domain using classes (the "frames") and their attributes (known as "slots"). This information is used by an inference engine to mimic the expert reasoning.

However the description of the individual properties of objects (frames and their slots) is not sufficient. We would like to add a notion of structural relation between objects. For instance two objects of class Person may be connected by a relation "wedlock", two objects in a scene may be connected by a spatial relation "on top of", etc. These relations are to be recognized, their constraints verified, and their contents filled up along the reasoning.

The purpose of this internship is to introduce relations as first-class citizen into our frame language: describe them, their properties, the means to express their constraints (e.g., cardinality, naviguability, optionality, etc.), and implement these concepts (in C++).

The ORION team has developed video sequence interpretation platform capable of detecting and tracking moving objects and recognizing certain behaviors that are predefined by experts in a database of scenarii. Especially, the platform has been tested for various applications such as metro and bank surveillance.

In addition to the a priori knowledge about the scenarii to be recognized and the environment observed, at each instant, the recognition process takes as input: (1) a set of individuals being tracked by a vision module and (2) a set of scenarii already recognized. The output of the process is a set of scenarii recognized for the current instant. A scenario is a model of the behavior of one or several individuals evolving in a scene in a given duration. A scenario is composed of a sequence of sub-scenarii meeting some temporal constraints.

For many applications, it is interesting to make use of other information coming from heterogeneous sensors such as cameras, microphones, piezo-electric sensors, etc. This is especially relevant for usual activities in the context of home automation or home nursing of elderly people. It is thus necessary to develop multisensor analysis techniques for human activity monitoring.

The first objective of the internship is to propose methods for multisensor analysis of the information about the state of persons being observed. The next objective is to find solutions that are general enough to be integrated into the existing video interpretation platform of the ORION group. The internship consists of both a theoretical study and the implementation of a practical application, such as home nursing of elderly people.

The first step will be a bibliographic study on the subject. The second step will be the development of a new multisensor analysis method of human activities. An implementation of the proposed method should follow and be tested with the VSIP platform, developed by the ORION group.

The perceived real world is dynamic and contains uncertainty. Therefore, the image interpretation process is often subject to errors and difficult to evaluate. The Techno-Vision ETISEO project (Jan 2005 - 2007) aims at the evaluation of video interpretation techniques for video surveillance applications. The task of the ORION group consists of proposition of evaluation metrics, a tool for automatic comparison of video analysis results with ground truth, as well as execution of their own algorithms on the reference video data of the ETISEO project.

Aerobiology had undergone a dramatic expansion in the last 10 years with the formation of many national pollen sampling networks. According to recent epidemiological studies, between 15-20 affected by pollinosis. Evidence suggest that this percentage is increasing because of changing environmental conditions such as pollution. The term aeroallergen has been created to resume in one word the particles dispersed through the atmosphere which are able to create allergy responses in sensitive people.

When several yearly data series are achieved, methodological approaches are employed to obtain an empirical mathematical model for each selected pollen type or vegetal species. To construct these models phenological, aerobiological (pollen counts) and meteorological parameters (mainly rain and temperatures from the previous months weather conditions) are considered and they have an statistics base.

In Europe the instrument most widely used to sample allergenic airborne pollen is the Hirst sampler. This is a suction sampler based on the basic impact principle. The capture of the pollen grains occurs by impact on a sticky surface that is then adequately prepared to be examined under the optical microscopy. The pollen grain is drawn into the sampler by suction from a vacuum pump. A vane tail keeps the sampler orifice facing the wind.

One slide per operating day is obtained from this sensor. The task of the palynologist technician is to "count" this slide, this means to recognise on it the pollen particles, to give every pollen a name (family, genus, specie, group) and to produce a slide pollen spectrum at the end for the given day. The results can also be expressed per hour, this means hourly aerobiological data. This level of aerobiological analysis is also very interesting, because plants shed the pollen at different periods along the day and this knowledge can help allergy sufferers.

The technician do not read the whole slide, which could involve a lot of working time, and so the slide reading is also a sample. As a general rule, accepted by most of the European Aerobiological Groups, almost the 10 the slide must be read. Even using this type of sub-sampling, pollen count involves a great deal of working time because operators take about three hours to do readings for each daily slide to obtain a measure of mean daily pollen concentration. If the pollen analysis is made to obtain the results expressed per hour, the working time used to do the slide readings is notably increased.

Not only because of the time required to obtain the pollen measurements from the sensor's samples but also because possible human errors of counting and identifying the pollen grains can occur, it is of enormous interest to develop a system capable to recognise the pollen grains and to count them per types, this means to make possible an automatic evaluation of the atmospheric pollen concentration.

Automated image focusing on pollen grains: In microscopy, the conception of a process for automated analysis of samples implies that the reading device is able to rectify image sharpness in real time. Here, it is demonstrated that the association of the relative sharpness criterion SML (Sum Modified Laplacian) and a maximum search strategy ensuing from Fibonaci's paradigm, leads onto a fast and robust algorithm for automated sharpness rectification.

Localisation of pollen grains from colour information: In order to sort particles on the samples and localise the pollen grains, an algorithm based on a split and merge scheme with markovian relaxation, has been developed for joint segmentation of a luminance plane and a chrominance plane, coming from the principal components analysis of specific RGB data of the application. Automated interpretation of the segmentation results completes the colour analysis module and also enables an efficient localisation of the grains (more than 90 the strong variations of coloration among the different pollen types). The repetitive aspects of the sample slide analysis is totally automated.

Four pollen types have been selected in the A.S.T.H.M.A. project.  The choice has been based on their frequencies in the study area as well as their allergenic capacities.  The selection includes pollen from Cupressaceae, Olea europea, Poaceae and Parietaria types.

Cupressaceae comprises several species distributed in the Mediterranean area.  Most of them are frequent in the cities as ornemental trees, blossoming during winter.  Then Cupressaceae pollen is the main responsible of the winter pollinosis.  The pollen grains are light and easily wind dispersed.  As a result of our research, pollen production per tree is very high and the quantity depends on the different species.

Olea pollen is represented by only one species, Olea europea.  This species is distributed in the Mediterranean area and widely cultivated for oil production.  Moreover, this pollen type is one of the main inducers of allergy.  Although this trees are secondary anemophilous, their pollens are well dispersed by wind.  Pollen production per tree is very high and the blossoming occurs during the spring.

Poaceae pollen comprises a large number of species, most of them annual herbs, well distributed in the studied area.  These pollens are one of the most important aeroallergens across Europe, although their relative contribution to pollinosis varies regionally in relation to local vegetation, agriculture and climate.  Although some species flower in winter, summer or autumn, most of them do it in spring.  The pollen production per plant is, in general, scarce and it varies notably between species.

Parietaria pollen type involves some species of the Urticaceae family.  Urtica and Parietaria species are ruderal, and abundant in urban environments.  Parietaria pollen is a very important aeroallergen in the Mediterranean region.  Its pollen is well dispersed due to its small size.  Although most of the species flower in the spring season, some Parietaria do it in autumn.

Pollen grains identification under light microscopy is based on morphological characteristics such as shape, size, apertures and ornementation.  The combination of these characteristics makes some pollen grains easily identifiable, showing low confusion possibility.  But there are also pollen grains sharing several common characteristics that make identification difficult.

Once decided the four A.S.T.H.M.A. pollen types, and begun the transfer of palynological information for developing the semi-automatic system for pollen recognition, it appeared very clear the need to include in the study the pollen types similar, in order to avoid confusions and overestimates.

In order to decide which pollen types are similar to the main A.S.T.H.M.A. pollens that will be included in the project, two main aspects were taken into consideration: the abundance of the similar pollen in the atmosphere and the coincidence in the pollination periods of similar pollen types.

Only the experts in palynology are able to recognise the class (family, genus, specie, group) of a given pollen grain. For that, they use their general knowledge in palynology such as pollen taxonomy, schematic representations of the various pollen classes in terms of their sub-parts or their characteristics, and the pollinic calendars depending on the geographical location. An automatic pollen recognition system has to be guided by this knowledge.

We have developed an original interface, named annotate, that allows the expert to look into a 3D image sequence and annotate it with texts and drawings to indicate key characteristics for the recognition.

To accomplish the recognition, it is necessary to work on 3D images and to use deep palynological knowledge.  This knowledge describes the pollen types according to their main visible characteristerics and to those which are important for recognition.  The strategy used for recognition first detects the pollen grain boundaries in 3D.  Then, the main characteristics are searched for according to their location.  For example, the top surface is analyzed to understand the ornamentation    while the central images help to identify the cytoplasm or the exine thickness.  The detection algorithms work on 2D images and validate their result in 3D (i.e. a pore is detected and validated if it appears in several images).  Such algorithms use image processing methods like thresholding, gradient analysis, region segmentation, color analysis. Different algorithms are developed to identify a single characteristic with different appearances (a pore is seen differently from the polar view than the equatorial view).

For example, we can compute the diameter (in microns) vs the mean blue colour for each grain to see that already we can identify some specific types (Parietaria for example).  For other types, more knowledge-based techniques will have to be used.

The cytoplasm of the Cupressaceae is located in the center of the grain.  It is known to have a star-like shape, but this cannot be verifier for many examples.  It appears mostly as a bright zone visible in several images near the center.

This system has been developed to help naturalists, such as geologists, pedologists, or foresters who are not specialists in computer vision.  It automatically processes the data coming from satellites.

The role of such a system is to convert the requirements of a user, expressed in terms of user requests, into the correct image processing commands. Consequently, the users can concentrate their attention on the interpretation of the results and not on the data management.

Lama is a software platform devoted to the design of Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS), i.e. to both knowledge base and reasoning engine design. It provides experts or engine designers with a generic environment, composed of common tools that can be shared among different KBS.

The platform offers both experts and designers a high level of abstraction for their work, which is independent of any programming language, while rich enough to express their needs. First, experts can share graphical knowledge base visualisation interfaces and an expertise description language. Second,engine designers can configure their engines by means of a library of generic and reusable components. They can also test, compare, reuse or modify different engines in a unified framework.

Designers of KBS engines can carry their design at a level of abstraction close to the design process one, freeing them from implementation details, by means of an object-oriented framework (BLOCKS library). The library is easy to extend and to adapt to new reaso ning needs. Domain experts also benefit from the implementation-independent approach. All the engines share the same common toolbox for knowledge base development and use, so it is easy to try different engine strategies in order to find the most suitable one, without major modifi cation of the knowledge base description.

In problem solving, several reasoning strategies can be applied. Depending on the task to solve, these strategies are different and use information about different entities, organized in different ways.

The core of the platform is the BLOCKS object- oriented framework, which is a library of reasoning components (i.e. structures and instructions) These abstract components hide the underlying implementation language. The library is divided into general and task-specific layers.

A task-specific layer focusses on the primary needs of a task. For example, if the target task is planning its layer will implement reusable reasoning components to perform different kinds of planning.

The language for expertise description provides experts, i.e. knowledge engineers and domain experts, with syntactical templates for both general and task-specific concepts. It it used for the developement of knowledge bases. Associated to this language, are a translator into implementation-level code, a knowledge base verification toolkit, and graphical interfaces. This set of tools constitutes the expert's interface.

We are interested in knowledge-based techniques (called program supervision) for managing the reuse of a modular set of programs. The focus of this paper is to analyse which reuse problems program supervision techniques can solve. First, we propose a general definition for program supervision, a knowledge representation model, and a reasoning model. Then we analyse program supervision solution for reuse in terms of the structure of the programs to re-use and in terms of the effort for building a program supervision knowledge base. The paper concludes with what program supervision can do for program reuse from the points of view of the code developers, the experts, and the end-users.

Techniques of program supervision favour the capitalization of knowledge about the use of complex programs and the operationalization of this utilization for users non specialist in the domain offering them help concerning the choice, parametrizing and sequencing of programs.

This paper describes experience we have gained in using program supervision techniques for integration and control of image processing programs. The role of these knowledge-based techniques is to handle high level knowledge about the use of programs together with their effective execution and control.

Then we present three major classes of application domains where we have applied program supervision techniques: road obstacle detection, medical imaging and astronomy. From these experiments, we conclude that program supervision techniques are good candidates to perform a semantical integration of image processing programs. These techniques are independent of any particular application domain or image processing programs.  We propose a general architecture for such systems, which can be slightly tuned for specific purposes.  For code designers, semantical integration implies to think from the beginning about how their image processing programs can be integrated and controlled.

We propose a framework for the development of vision systems that incorporate, along with the executable computer algorithms, the problem-solving knowledge required to obtain optimal performance from them. In this approach, the user provides the input data, specifies the vision task to be performed, and then provides feedback in the form of qualitative evaluations of the results obtained. These assessments are interpreted in a knowledge-based framework to automatically select algorithms and set parameters until results of the desired quality are obtained. This approach is illustrated on two real applications, and example from the knowledge bases developed are discussed in detail.

Our objective is to offer clinicians wider access to evolving medical image processing (MIP) techniques, crucial to improve assessment and quantification of physiological processes, but difficult to handle for non-specialists in MIP. Based on artificial intelligence techniques, our approach consists in the development of a knowledge-based program supervision system, automating the management of MIP libraries. It comprises a library of programs, a knowledge base capturing the expertise about programs and data and a supervision engine. It selects, organises and executes the appropriate MIP programs given a goal to achieve and a data set, with dynamic feedback based on the results obtained. It also advises users in the development of new procedures chaining MIP programs. We have experimented the approach for an application of Factor Analysis of Medical Image Sequences as a means of predicting the response of osteosarcoma to chemotherapy, with both MRI and NM dynamic image sequences. As a result our program supervision system frees clinical end-users from performing tasks outside their competence, permitting them to concentrate on clinical issues. Therefore our approach enables a better exploitation of possibilities offered by MIP and higher quality results, both in terms of robustness and reliability.

This paper describes the use of a knowledge-based system to manage a library of image processing programs which performs the computation of land cover mixing in pixels of a multi-spectral satellite image. This system has been developed to help naturalists, such as geologists, pedologists, or foresters who are not specialists in computer vision. It automatically processes the data coming from satellites. The role of such a system is to convert the requirements of a user, expressed in terms of user requests, into the correct image processing commands. Consequently, the users can concentrate their attention on the interpretation of the results and not on the data management. Finally, some examples are shown.

The main theme of this conference is the interplay between software engineering and knowledge engineering: how knowledge engineering methods can assist the software engineer and how software engineering techniques can be applied in knowledge engineering. To this end, SEKE'96 aims to bring together academic and industrial researchers and software developers from many countries to exchange ideas and results. Preference will be given to papers that emphasize the main theme, but outstanding papers on software engineering or knowledge engineering alone are also solicited.

SEKE '96 will feature four half-day tutorials on June 19, followed by a three-day technical program consisting of parallel tracks which will include paper sessions, panels, and workshops. Tool demos also are planned. Paper presentations will be approximately 20 minutes each with 5-10 minutes for questions and discussion.

An important goal of image synthesis is to achieve accurate, efficient and consistent sampling and reconstruction of illumination varying over surfaces in an environment. A new approach is introduced for the treatment of diffuse polyhedral environments lit by area light sources, based on the identification of important properties of illumination structure. The properties of unimodality and curvature of illumination in unoccluded environments are used to develop a high quality sampling algorithm which includes error bounds. An efficient algorithm is presented to partition the scene polygons into a mesh of cells, in which the visible part of the source has the same topology.

The behaviour of illumination in the penumbral regions is carefully studied, and is shown to be monotonic and well behaved within most of the mesh cells.  An algorithm to reduce the mesh size, and an algorithm which selects between linear and quadratic interpolants are presented.

The results show that the mesh size and the degrees of the interpolants can be reduced without significant degradation of image quality. The preceding algorithms are combined into a complete structured sampling approach that allows accurate and efficient representation of illumination using interpolating polynomials for scenes with occlusion.  Images with accurate shadows can be produced from the structured representation using either ray-casting or polygon rendering hardware. Finally, it is shown that our methodology generalises easily to the global illumination problem. An iterative solution to a Galerkin finite element approach is proposed, and it is shown how the structured algorithms provide a good initial approximation for the iteration, enhance efficiency for numerical integration and allow adaptive mesh modification. The structure-driven global illumination algorithm thus promises significant improvement over previous higher-order finite element solutions.

I have acquired a wide variety of skills in the domains of computer graphics, acoustics and scientific software programming. During my PhD research, I developed a novel technique based on the hierarchical radiosity method allowing to perform combined graphics/sound rendering at interactive rates.

Further developments of my work are also promising, in particular room/exterior acoustics prediction and radiowave propagation simulation with application to telecommunication or high speed wireless local networks.

We focused our efforts on three main problems: interactive calculation of sound occlusion by obstacles, integration of sound simulation in an interactive 3D animation system and adaptive simulation of sound reflections in reverberant environments.

Then, we describe an interactive system for integrated sound and graphics rendering in the context of computer animation or virtual reality. This system integrates the previous interactive occlusion rendering technique.

Eventually, we introduce a new adaptive simulation technique based on a hierarchical radiosity-like approach as used in lighting simulations. It allows for taking into account global specular and diffuse reflections in the context of time-varying energy exchanges.

The obtained solution is independent of the listening position which makes the approach well suited to walkthrough applications. Moreover, the complexity of the process can be tuned to reach more quantitative results, making it usable for room acoustic quality prediction.

Left: We use multiple arbitrarily positioned microphones (circled in yellow) to simultaneously record real-life auditory environments. Middle: We analyze the recordings to extract the positions of various sound components through time. Right: This high-level representation allows for post-editing and re-rendering the acquired soundscape within generic 3D audio rendering architectures.

In particular, we can move or alter the different sound sources and arbitrarily choose the listening position. We can also composite elements of different scenes together in a spatially consistent way.

The widespread availability and increasing processing power of GPUs could offer an alternative solution. GPU features, like multiply-accumulate instructions or multiple execution units, are similar to those of most DSPs used for audio processing [4,9]. Besides, 3D audio rendering applications require a significant number of geometric calculations, which are a perfect fit for the GPU. Our feasibility study investigates the use of GPUs for efficient audio processing.

We consider a combination of two simple operations commonly used for 3D audio rendering: variable delay-line and filtering. The signal of each sound source is first delayed by the propagation time of the sound wave. This involves resampling the signal at non-integer index values and automatically accounts for Doppler shifting.

Binaural stereo rendering requires applying this pipeline twice, using a direction-dependent delay and equalization for each ear, derived from head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) [1,8]. Similar audio processing can be used to generate dynamic sub-mixes of multiple sound signals prior to spatial audio rendering.

A possible explanation, besides multiple SIMD execution units and memory bandwidth, for the good performance of the GPU is the use of specific instructions for dot product and linear interpolation. Such instructions are not currently part of the SSE. The latest graphics architectures are likely to significantly improve GPU performance due to their increased number of pipelines and better floating-point texture support.

The huge pixel throughput of the GPU can also be used to improve audio rendering quality without reducing frame-size by recomputing rendering parameters (source-to-listener distance, equalization gains, etc.) on a per-sample rather than per-frame basis. This can be seen as an audio equivalent of per-pixel vs. per-vertex lighting. Since fragment programs can be dynamically activated, such processing can be used only when necessary (e.g., for near-field fast moving sources). By storing directivity functions in cube-maps and recomputing propagation delays and distances on a per-sample basis, our GPU implementation can still render up to 180 sources in the same time-frame.

However, more complex texture addressing calculations are needed in the fragment program due to limited texture size. By replacing such complex texture addressing with a single texture-fetch instruction, we estimated that direct support for large 1D textures would increase performance by at least a factor of 2.

Infinite impulse response (recursive) filtering cannot be implemented efficiently since past values are usually unavailable when rendering a given pixel in fragment programs. As suggested in [2], including persistent registers to accumulate results across fragments might solve this problem. Improved vertex processing available on the latest GPUs might offer another solution. This would also allow GPUs to be used for complex physically-based sound synthesis (e.g., modal synthesis [3]) in games or simulators and accelerate costly plug-ins for audio sequencers and multi-track editors.

Slow AGP readbacks might also become an issue when large amounts of audio data must be retrieved from graphics memory to be transfered to the audio hardware for playback. However, upcoming PCI Express support should solve this problem for most applications.

Finally, our results support our hypothesis that game-audio hardware, borrowing from graphics architectures and shading languages, may benefit from including a programmable ``voice processor" prior to their main effects processor. The architecture of such a processor could be inspired from the GPU while high level shading languages might inspire high-level audio processing languages for future programmable APUs.

We present a new approach to efficiently compute effects of sound occlusion and diffraction by obstacles in general virtual acoustic environments. Based on the Fresnel-Kirchoff approximation to diffraction, our method uses a 3D model of the environment and computer graphics hardware to evaluate diffraction effects between a sound source and a receiver position. No further hypothesis is needed on the diffracting domain. This method allows us to compute attenuation data and filters which can then be used for auralization. The method can also be extended to indirect sound propagation paths.

With the development of virtual reality systems and multi-modal simulations, soundtrack generation is becoming an important issue in computer graphics. In the context of computer generated animation, many more parameters than the sole object geometry as well as specific events can be used to generate, control and render a soundtrack that fits the object motions. Producing a convincing soundtrack involves the rendering of the interactions of sound with the dynamic environment : in particular sound reflections and sound absorption due to partial occlusions, usually implying an unacceptable computational cost. We present an integrated approach to sound and image rendering in a computer animation context, which allows the animator to recreate the process of sound recording, while ``physical effects" are automatically computed. Moreover, our sound rendering process efficiently combines a sound reflection model and an attenuation model due to scattering/diffraction by partial occluders, through the use of graphics hardware allowing interactive computation rates.

Geometrical theory of Diffraction is an extension of geometrical optics aimed at taking into account diffraction i.e. light/sound propagating in the geometrical shadow regions of an obstacle. We designed a system that can construct and evaluate in real-time the contribution of any hybrid reflection/diffraction path in a general 3D environment.

Several approaches have been developed to solve this difficult problem, but they are usually very costly in terms of computing power or limited to canonical cases. Part of my PhD work was aimed to develop a new technique allowing to take into account the effects of sound occlusion that could give satisfying approximation to the solution very quickly and for general cases. In order to achieve fast calculations we proposed to use a 3D rendering of the 3D model of the envenronment to simulate. The information that is rendered can be obtained through the standard cabled graphics pipeline using the OpenGL graphics library available on most platforms.

Based on this framework we developped two methods. The first one is a real-time qualitative method based on the occlusion ration of the 1st Fresnel ellipsoids. The second is an extension to more quantitative results using Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction theory. These two methods allow for computing attenuation values for different frequencies and thus diffraction maps.

The system simulates the propagation paths from an arbitrary number of point sources (including the image-sources) to an arbitrary number of point receivers. Each path is processed using resampling of the source signal and short FIR convolution with the path impulse reponse. At the end of the process, contributions of each receiver can be mapped to the selected restitution system (mono, stereo, stereo binaural, stereo transaural, matriced, multi-channel) using a corresponding mixing engine.

One direct applications of the techniques developped during my PhD is room acoustics simulations. Given a 3D model of a room and the acoustic properties of the surfaces, we can calculate at any location the room 'response'.

This response is a digital filter that encodes all sound modifications as it propagates from the source to the receiver. From this filter we can reproduce the sound as if it was heard in the room (auralization process) or calculate several quality criterias in order to evaluate the room acoustics. These criteria can then be visualized in order to help the designers improving the room acoustic quality.

My main research activity lies in the application of mathematical methods and algorithms for performance modeling and analysis of telecommunication systems. So, most of the times I find myself working somewhere between telecommunications systems engineering and applied mathematics. My interests include mostly areas of probabilities and stochastics, but also optimization, dynamic systems and control, machine learning, simulation methods, information theory and game theory.

Flow control is one of the exciting challenges in telecommunication networks. From a control theoretic view point these are extremely complex and difficult problems, since they often require decentralized mechanisms, information is often partial and noizy.

Moreover, in high-speed networks the propagation delay may be quite large in comparison to the transmission delay, so that the information available to the controller are typically delayed and out of date. I have been involved in the analysis of the TCP/IP window-type congestion control within a contract with France Telecom - C.N.E.T. I have also been interested in rate-based flow control, which has been selected by the ATM forum as the main approach for the flow control in in the Available Bit Rate (ABR) service. I have especially been interested in applying control theoretical tools in such control schemes.

Then the loss probability of a message cannot simply be calculated through the loss probabilities of individual packets, since these losses are not independent. We propose several models to we calculate these probabilities explicitely. This is a starting point for the analysis of the effect of adding redundant packets to messages, which allows to reconstruct losses. Other problems in which we need to compute the loss probabilities of messages arise in message discarding policies (early discard, partial or selective discard).  Another type of problem we study is the delay of a message that contains N packets. This again cannot be calculated from the delay of single packets, and require an analysis based on multi-dimensional (PGF).

I'm interested in the performance evaluation of token-ring local area networks. These networks have often been modeled by ``polling systems" in which a single server moves cyclically between queues; the average throughput, delay, cycle time duration etc. for polling systems have been analyzed for Poisson input processes.

Local-area networks are, however, more complex. They involve time constraints for asynchronous traffic, and the Poisson assumption on the arrival process is often unrealistic. This poses an interesting challenge in the analysis of local area networks based on token-ring protocols.

Quite often dynamic programming techniques can be used in order to obtain the structure of optimal policies in the control of queueing systems, even when the state space is infinite. This then allows to reduce a dynamic control problem into an optimization problem over a relatively small parameter set, and, in some cases, to fully solve the problem.

Together with Bruno Gaujal and Arie Hordijk, we layed some foundations for non Markovian control of discrete event dynamic systems in a series of papers. The theory is related to multimodularity properties of the immediate cost functions.

We are interested in situations of stochastic control with more than one controller. The objective of the controllers might be different, which leads to the framework of stochastic games. We are especially interested in problems arrising from queueing applications, where the information available to different controllers might be different, where the natural setting is of an infinite state space, and where costs are typically unbounded.

We analyze systems having two types of dynamics: one, determined by differential equations that corresponds to some process having a smooth behavior, and another discrete part that is directly controlled. Assuming that the discrete process changes much quicker that the continuous part, we are able to obtain some policies which  are asymptotically optimal.

Scopo  The Internet has emerged from complicated interactions among many independent and self-interested economic agents, such as service providers, network operators, users, etc. Game theory provides us with a set of effective tools to understand these interactions. In this seminar we will survey recent research at the interface between game theory and computer networks, with a focus on problems arising in the context of the Internet. Students will be introduced to key concepts from game theory and their applications in computer networks such as routing, congestion control, overlay networks, wireless and sensor networks, network formation, mechanism design, security, etc. In this seminar, we will also try to identify open research challenges and directions.

Clusters of Web caches are extensively used by different types of organizations, including companies, universities, ISPs, and CDNs. To model Web caches, we must account for two types of stochastic events: objects being pulled into/out of the cache cluster at random times, and caches going up and down at random times. Detailed stochastic models of such complex systems quickly become intractable. In this paper we propose a stochastic fluid model which captures the salient characteristics of a cache cluster. The stochastic fluid model replaces the object arrivals to the cluster and departures (object modification/expiration) with a fluid flow, but maintains the up/down dynamics of the original system. The model can be applied to a variety of cluster routing policies, and provides a simple means to estimate the hit rate. We compare the results of the stochastic fluid model with that of a simulation of the real system. We find the fluid model to not only be a close approximation, but also to exhibit the key qualitative properties of the original system. We conclude that stochastic fluid models show great potential in modeling a variety of content distribution systems.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are complex to analyze, due to their large number of users who connect intermittently, and to the frequency of requests for files or Web objects. In this paper we propose a mathematical model where request streams are represented as fluid flows and apply it to analyze Squirrel, a recent P2P cooperative Web cache. Our fluid model provides a low-complexity means to estimate the performance of Squirrel (hit probability, latency) and exhibits some key qualitative properties of this system. A comparison with discrete-event simulation validates the accuracy of our model.

Big interest in life, sports, people, animals, nature, travelling, thinking, solving problems, talking, and discovering the world with all the beauty in it. In general one could say that I enjoy any activity which involves one or more of the following: nature, being with other people, sports, helping the world to smile, challenges, and/or pushing the limits mentally or physically.

Sports in general include skating, gymnastics, snowboarding, canyoning, climbing, running, hiking, and squash. In general I manage to get three or four of these into one week (and if I get lucky all).

Two big hobbies in my life are squeezing as many minutes into a day as possible and trying to wear myself out (for the people who do not know me, this is actually a LOT more difficult than you can imagine). Because of these two hobbies I usually end up doing other hobbies as well such as travelling, voluntering myself to test my girlfriend's cooking (which is excellent by the way), eating icecream, learning, photography, and trying to get some decent french out of my mouth.

This is a script for working with short TCP files with several source nodes, sharing a single bottleneck link. It is used to show how with proper choice of CIR, marking decreases losses of vulnerable packets (syns etc).

MISTRAL is devoted to building and solving mathematical models, developing algorithmic tools and softwares for analyzing, evaluating, optimizing and controlling the performance of random discrete-event systems and, in particular, of communication networks and protocols. The nature of the research is both fundamental with the study of various formalisms (queueing theory, game theory, Markov decision processes, etc.) and applied with the objective of obtaining qualitative and quantitative insights on network behavior.

MISTRAL cooperates with  Alcatel Space Industries on two different topics. The first one is the development of (in particular TCP) traffic models; the second one bears on the optimization and dimensioning of satellite communications.

Taught various courses at the Computing Science and Telecommunications Program including: junior undergraduate course in Numerical Analysis, undergraduate course in Computer Architecture, and introductory courses.

In recent years, the ns-2 simulator has become one of the de facto standards (if not the standard) for the simulation of packet-switched networks, as attested by the number of research papers and IETF documents based on it, as well as by the wide scope of the networking technologies it handles. It is widely used in both academia and industry as a means of designing, testing and evaluating new and existing protocols and architectures, and it is also a very useful tool for educational purposes.

The main goals of the WNS2 workshop are: to bring together networking researchers from both academia and industry, to discuss recent advances, to identify future directions in network simulation, and to foster interdisciplinary collaborative research in this area.

Information Theory (IT) is concerned with identifying, characterization and computation of basic limits of performance measures of communication systems. The classical question that it seeks to answer is what are the information rates in the multi-user setting that can be transmitted reliably over a given noisy channel. The transmission may involve various transmitter and various receivers. Rendering transmission over noisy channels reliable involves coding of the information to be transmitted. A given transmission rate vector C is said to be reliable if for any rate C' < C and every epsilon > 0 there exists a code that allows transmission at the rate C' with error rates smaller than epsilon. The set of reliable transmission rates C are called the capacity region. In this proposal we seek to create cooperation between specialists on classical information theory (IT) and other disciplines that are needed for the computations of new concepts of capacity that appear in the next generation networks in which the geometric aspects, mobility, power restriction and non-cooperative behavior play a key role on the capacity and connectivity. In view of the wealth of mathematical tools that are needed to study networks (and in particular SNs), the IFANY group will focus on inter-disciplinary research for networking dimensioning and design.

The objective of this thesis was to model Web traffic and analyze the performance of Web servers and Web caches. We aimed at constructing a realistic model which is robust and flexible enough in order to remain valid in a wide range of utilizations (new protocols or servers). This led us to define a notion of Web sessions, and to consider the traffic as a marked point process, where marks include in particular the number of clicks and the duration elapsed between successive clicks. The validation of the model was done by comparing different statistical properties against those of real traffic. For the performance evaluation of servers, we used an experimental approach. For this, we generated Web traffic with our model. We then used this synthetic traffic to compare the performance of two versions of the HTTP protocol, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1, as well as the performance of Apache and Jigsaw servers.

In a second part, we studied Web caches, both at client (often called proxy-caching) and server sides. More precisely, we focused our work on removal policies for the replacement algorithm of caches. We built a simulator based on the technique of trace driven simulation.  We proposed and evaluated a static policy for server cache. For proxy caches, we proposed a policy that takes into account the network latency, the size and the accessed frequencies of the documents as well as the time elapsed since the last referenced to documents in the cache. We compared this policy with other well known policies through several standard metrics.

Abstract : Vehicular networks bring the promise of increased safety and efficiency of road traffic; they are likely to become the most important incarnation of mobile ad hoc networks. Yet, a number of technical issues still need to be solved, owing to the stringent constraints of system response time and node velocity. In addition, it appears that securing this family of networks is both mandatory and very challenging; each node must perform a high number of cryptographic and communication operations in order to protect the network against possible attacks (see e.g. http://ivc.epfl.ch). In this talk, we will first explain the overall context of vehicular networks and then focus on their security, an issue that has been (surprisingly) overlooked by the research community. We will then describe the related performance challenges and sketch how they could be tackled. The understanding of this talk does not require any specific expertise in security or in cryptography, as we will introduce the (few) necessary concepts.

Abstract : We are on the threshold of an era of building large automated systems, e.g., smart highways or air transportation management systems. We expect control, i.e., both sensing and actuation, over networks to represent an important aspect of the next phase of the information technology revolution. In order to facilitate its proliferation we believe that it is important to elucidate what are appropriate abstractions and what is a matching architecture. Also important are performance analysis, and a theoretical framework for design and operation. We describe our efforts in this direction. We propose a virtual collocation layer that is supported by a middleware called Etherware. We illustrate several applications running in a laboratory testbed in our Convergence Laboratory. Finally, we sketch an outline for addressing overall performance. (Joint work with Girish Baliga, Scott Graham, Craig Robinson and Hans-Joerg Schuetz).

Abstract: How do properties of wireless multi-hop networks scale with their size? With the advent of ad hoc and sensor networks, this question has given birth to an intense research activity in networking. Traditional methods from stochastic performance are not adequate to solve this problem: new tools are needed. In this tutorial, we review some of the recent results on connectivity, transport capacity, throughput scaling in large scale wireless networks. A particular emphasis is put on techniques from percolation theory that played a key role in solving some of these questions.

Next, we compute the transport capacity in wireless multi-hop networks. Following the physical model of Gupta and Kumar, and using percolation theory, we show that n randomly scattered nodes can achieve the optimal 1/sqrt(n) per-node transmission rate of arbitrarily located nodes.

"Unfortunately, the vast majority of mobility models [...] suffer from decay; average speed decreases until converging to some long-term average. Such decay provides an unsound basis for simulation studies that collect results averaged over time, complicating the experimental process".

"The random waypoint model is considered harmful". The "harmfulness" of random waypoint can be attributed to the uniform selection of speed over the interval [vmin, vmax], with vmin = 0. Taking vmin > 0 solves the problem.

Such questions have been addressed on a case by case basis in the literature. However, the derivations involve long and complex computations, leaving the reader with little understanding of the "why". In fact, all the properties and problems mentioned above can be simply explained and analyzed using the Palm inversion formula. The Palm theory , due to the complexity of its construction, is not widely used nor even known in applied areas. We explain Palm calculus in a concise, yet rigorous, manner. Then we apply it to the random waypoint model and variants (with pause time, random walk, random trip). We show how to simply obtain the stationary distribution of nodes and speeds, on a connected (possibly non convex) area. We also show how to perform a perfect (i.e. transient free) simulation without computing complicated integrals. We analyze decay and explain it as either convergence to steady state or lack of convergence. Last, with stationary but long range dependent models, we analyze the implications on simulation averaging.

The tutorial is intended for researchers in wireless networking. The focus is on description of models, relationship with various wireless standards, justification of assumptions, description of algorithms and their performance. The attendee is expected to have basic understanding of computer networking and familiarity with performance analysis tools for computer networks. The analysis techniques behind the results will be mentioned only briefly, pointers will be provided to the interested attendees for in depth elaboration.

Abstract: A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes that dynamically self organize in a wireless network without using any pre-existing infrastructure. In a MANET, the applications are typically "peer-to-peer" (P2P) rather than "client-server". Moreover, a MANET is often built to support a specific application, thus the networking is application-driven. The tutorial will start with an overview of the two main scenarios: Person-to-person communication and car-to-car networking. Then, a thorough discussion of the two building blocks of a P2P system, i.e., distributed lookup services and reliable data transport, will be given. The tutorial shows that P2P systems designed for the wired Internet cannot be deployed in MANET in a straightforward way and present epidemic data dissemination as an effective approach to cope with the shortcomings.

Abstract: The teletraffic theory was born in 1917 when Erlang published his famous formula giving the call blocking probability as a function of the traffic intensity and the link capacity. The Erlang formula has since been used to dimension all telephone networks, including recent cellular networks. It may be argued that its enduring success is essentially due to the following insensitivity property that makes it so simple: the blocking probability does not depend on the distribution of call duration.

Two recent breakthroughs make this possible: Our new simplex algorithm for the solution of SCLP enables us to calculate optimal fluid solutions. The recent maximum pressure policy of Dai and Lin in conjunction with the concept of infinite virtual buffers allows us to track the fluid solution. The resulting method is asymptotically optimal: as the number of items increases, the scaled system converges to the fluid solution, which is optimal. We will discuss each of the three steps of the fluid approach.

Maximum pressure policies were introduced by Dai and Lin.  At time t the maximum pressure allocation is u(t)= arg maxu Q(t)TRu, where the maximization is over the available extreme allocation vectors u. If the network satisfies the structural EAA assumption then u(t) will minimize the derivative of the Lyapunov function q(t)T q(t) and stabilize the network, whenever the utilization ρ is ≤ 1. This stability continues to hold for infinite virtual buffers, where stability implies that the buffer levels track the nominal inputs. Our fluid tracking policy tracks the fluid in each subinterval by classifying all non-empty fluid buffers as infinite virtual buffers, and using maximum pressure. We prove that this is asymptotically optimal.

Abstract: In this tutorial we discuss planning issues in call centers. A call center is a collection of resources (typically agents and ICT equipment) capable of handling customer contacts by telephone. If the call center handles not only telephone contacts but also contacts by fax, email, and so forth, then it is usually called a customer contact center. The goal of call center planning is to schedule call center representatives or agents in such a way that a certain minimal service level (SL) is obtained, for minimal costs. We focus on waiting time as main SL metric. Planning is done on several time scales: there are agent hiring strategies at the scale of months, there is workforce management at the scale of weeks, and there is intraday performance control at the scale of minutes and hours. We focus on workforce management and intraday performance. Planning is strongly related to the structure of the call center. We also discuss how decisions concerning the structure influence planning.

In the first part of this tutorial we focus on the current practice of workforce management (wfm). Central in wfm are performance models, with the Erlang C model as the most often used model. We discuss the whole wfm cycle consisting of forecasting, determination of staffing levels, and agent scheduling. In the second part of this tutorial we discuss the weak parts of the current practice. They have to do with random variations that are not well modeled (such as variations in arrival rate and in agent absence) and with human bahavior that is not captured by the Erlang C model. These issues have important consequences for the design of call centers. In the third and final part we discuss contact centers with different call types and different ways (such as internet) to communicate with the customer. These so-called multi-skill and multi-channel call centers give challenges at all planning levels. We discuss them, with a focus on the short-term performance models.

Abstract: The whereabouts of customers in a queueing system interact. If more customers join the queue, one's waiting time may increase, to such a level that one may prefer not to join at all. But who decides who will join and who will not? Also, if too many packets are routed along one path, then an individual packet might be better assigned to some other path. But who will select this path, the individual himself or a central planner? Their objective may not be the same. For another decision problem, suppose acquiring the information which line or path is shorter comes with some cost. What should one do? On the one hand, one has an incentive to pay for this information. On the other hand, this incentive decreases the larger the fraction becomes of those who acquire this information as the more informed customers will tend to make the two lines more even anyhow. The tutorial will deal with these and similar decision models.

Many decision problems in queues can be modeled as non-cooperative games. In such games players (or, in our case, customers, service providers or routers) have to take actions. While selecting their actions they are not fully informed on the actions taken by others. In fact, in many situations, decision making is done simultaneously. Of course, each player likes to optimize his gains (utility), but one's optimal action is a function of what others are doing. Here the solution concept of Nash equilibrium is introduced and it replaces the concept of optimal solution which is used when a single decision maker is assumed. Specifically, Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player (usually referred to as a strategy profile), so that assuming that all obey this recipe, each of the individuals does his best by following his share of this profile as well.

Most of the tutorial will be devoted to customers as decision makers who take actions as time progresses. Examples of that are to join or not to join the queue, which line to join, to pay or not to pay a premium in order to get higher priority, or to renege from the queue once waiting conditions deteriorate. We will also consider service providers as decision makers. Here the assumption is that they select some parameters while trying to maximize their or the society's revenues. Examples of that are selecting entry fees, designing set of priority premiums, or selecting service rates (ie, bandwidth allocation). The service providers analyze their revenues by considering the Nash equilibria in the games between customers resulting from any of their decisions.

The way the tutorial will approach the various decision models is by considering the information that customers possess when they select their actions. Specifically, we first look into models in which customers do not know the actual level of congestion when they make up their mind (the unobservable case), while in the second case we assume that they do know (the observable case). A classic example is when customers have to decide whether to queue or not to queue in a first-come first-served model where they are not informed of the actual queue length upon their arrival (the unobservable case) and when they are informed of the queue length (the observable case). Another example is when joining customers have the option to pay a premium in order to belong to a higher priority class of customers. One option of decision making here is when they do not know how many customers are in the system at decision instants (let alone how many belong to which class) while in the other they observe the number of customers belonging to each class. A few other examples will be given in the tutorial.

Any of the above games can be incorporated into the decision making faced by the service operator. For example, he can calculate for any entry fee what is the effective arrival rate (based on the above analysis of the game between customers), and hence can compute its revenue for each selected fee. In turn, the optimal fee can be found. Of course, in the unobservable case a one-for-all price has to be charged but in the observable case, prices can vary with the queue length. Another possible question is if the service provider should reveal the queue length to the customers or not so as to maximize profits (of course, assuming that this is at his discretion).

Speaker's biography: Moshe Haviv is currently a Professor at the Department of Statistics in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a Ph.D. from Yale (1983). He has also previously lectured at the University of British Columbia and the University of Sydney. In general, his main research interest is in queueing systems, and in particular, in the modelling and the analysis of decision making in congested systems as non-cooperative games. Specifically, two years ago he published (with Refael Hassin) a book entitled "To queue or not to queue: Equilibrium behavior in queueing system," (Kluwer International Series). It is the first book written on this topic and as well as its original content, it summarizes the state of the art on the topic of the interaction in decision making among customers, on the one hand, and the interaction between customers and service  providers, on the other. He has also made research contributions on the topics of Markov decision processes, on computational schemes for large Markov chains, and on singularly perturbed Markov chains.

Abstract: Worms and viruses pose a significant threat to computer systems in a highly networked environment where most home and corporate machines are connected to the Internet. In recent years, there have been several instances of worms spreading rapidly over the Internet and managing to infect most vulnerable hosts within 24 hours. The time between patch release and the release of a worm exploiting that vulnerability has been shrinking and it may soon happen that a worm appears before a patch is available (aka zero-day worms). It is widely accepted that a worm containment system for zero-day worms must be automatic as human-assisted response is too slow for effective containment. We need new techniques and analysis for fast-response systems of automatic containment.

In this tutorial, we first describe how worms differ from viruses and study some of their commonly used spreading strategies as well as potentially new ones. We then go on to discuss mathematical models of worm spread, which are in fact derived from classical models of biological epidemics that have been studied extensively for decades. Starting with a simple model of uniform scanning, we go on to consider progressively more complicated models that incorporate local preference in scanning and latencies and network effects. The aim is to give insights into the main qualitative features that are common to epidemic spread, irrespective of details of the worm scanning strategy.

We then go on to consider countermeasures. The primary class of countermeasures of interest involves automated worm detection and patch generation. The effectiveness of such a scheme depends on how quickly the worm can be detected and the patch generated, and then how quickly the patch can be disseminated to end systems. We discuss all three aspects of the response, with particular emphasis on the last one, namely the speed of patch dissemination. In order to compete with the rapid epidemic style spread of the worm, the patch also needs to rely on exponential growth. This could be achieved either by using epidemic spread again, or by relying on multicast trees or structured or unstructured overlays. We describe how the simple epidemic models studied earlier can be modified to incorporate the effect of countermeasures. The resulting analysis enables us to quantify how the fraction of hosts that eventually become infected depend on the various parameters describing the worm and the countermeasure. In particular, they help determine how fast patch dissemination needs to be in order for reactive patching to be successful in containing the epidemic.

The workshop will bring together researchers studying optimisation issues of mobile networks from both the network performance and the mobile networking perspectives.

In this paper, we derive a closed form formula for the average rate attained by a non persistent TCP source which alternates between idle periods and download periods subject to a fixed packet loss probability.

The formula for the mean transmission rate is shown to boil down to the classical square root mean value formula for persistent flows when the average file size tends to infinity. Using fixed point methods, these formulae can be applied to predict bandwidth sharing among competing HTTP flows subject to Active Queue Management.

We present a recursive formula for evaluating the flow throughput in a multirate system  with elastic traffic which is the analogue of the well-known Kaufman-Roberts formula used to evaluate the blocking probability in a multirate  system with circuit traffic.

Time synchronization is critical in distributed environments. A variety of network protocols, middleware and business applications rely on proper time synchronization across the computational infrastructure and depend on the clock accuracy.

This approach exploits convex optimization theory in order to evaluate the impact of each clock offset on the overall objective function. We define the clock offset problem as an optimization problem and derive its optimal solution.

We also present methodology and numerical results for evaluating and comparing the accuracy of time synchronization schemes. We show that the CTP substantially outperforms hierarchical schemes such as NTP in the sense of clock accuracy with respect to a universal clock, without increasing complexity.

Inverting flow properties from sampled traffic is known to be complex and prone to errors. Previous work has mainly focused on inverting general traffic properties such as flow size distribution, average flow size, or total number of flows. In this work, we study the feasibility of the inversion of individual flow properties. We address this problem by analyzing the detection and ranking of the largest flows from sampled traffic. Surprisingly, our analytical analysis indicates that a high sampling rate (10\% and even more) is required. To reduce the sampling rate by an order of magnitude, the ranking must be limited to just a few large flows, or the traffic must consist of several millions of flows.

On the basis of a reference model for  ADSL traffic on an IP backbone link, we show that it is possible to infer the characteristics  of long flows by performing a deterministic $1/N$ packet sampling. By using the fact that  the number of active long flows can be represented by means of the number of customers in  an  $M/G/\infty$  queue  with Weibullian  service times,  we  derive  some  probabilitic  properties of sampled data. These properties are then used  to infer the characteristics  of  original flows.

This work aims at investigating the performance of some TCP enhancements, proposed for networks with a very large bandwidth/delay product, in a geostationary satellite environment. Both persistent and elastic traffic patterns are considered, as well as static and mobile users. Performance evaluation, conducted via numerical simulations, shows the soundness of the use of such protocols in the scenario under consideration.

A model describing the discovery by means of traceroute of the topology an Internet access network with a  tree structure is proposed in  this study. This model allows  us to assess the efficiency  of traceroute procedures to determine  the complete set of  routers of the network. Under  some stochastic assumptions, explicit analytical  expressions are obtained for the  mean number of routers  discovered when a subset  of the stations is  used in the traceroute procedure. Several tree architectures  are then discussed when the total number of routers  gets large, and  asymptotic expansions are  derived. The results  are compared with real data obtained from measurements.

The replication of digital content in overlay networks makes the identification of the best server an interesting problem. In this work, our aim is to reduce the content transfer time, which we define it as the time required to download a digital content by a client using TCP. Our scheme consists of ranking the servers from the best one to the worst one based on a metric that corresponds to a prediction of the content transfer time from each server. Our prediction function considers the critical performance parameters that have an impact on the quality of the transfer, such as the load on the servers and the characteristics of the path between the client and the servers. Once the servers are ranked, the client can download the content on point-to-point from the best server, or in parallel from a subset of servers at the top of the list (best servers). Our experimental results show that our approach for identifying the best servers outperforms the existing classical solutions. Moreover, these results show that the proposed metric predicts the transfer time of a content with around 96% accuracy.

This work addresses two key issues in reliable multicast overlay networks : end-to-end reliability in the presence of node failure/overflow, and throughput scalability in the presence of random perturbations. A decentralized architecture is proposed for taking care of these two issues. This architecture uses distinct point to point TCP connections between adjacent pairs of end-systems, together with a window based back-pressure control, which links adjacent pairs of TCP connections via an application-layer mechanism. Each end-system maintains forwarding buffers and a back-up buffer storing copies of the forwarded packets. The forwarding buffers are used to enforce the back-pressure mechanism whereas the back-up buffer is dedicated to re-establishing connectivity in case of end-system failure. This architecture, that we propose to call the One-to-Many TCP Overlay, is a natural extension of TCP to the one-to-many case, in that it adapts the rate of the group communication to local congestion in a decentralized way via the window back-pressure mechanism.

Using theoretical investigations, experimentations in the Internet, and large network simulations, we show that this architecture provides end-to-end reliability and can tolerate multiple simultaneous node failures, provided the backup buffers are sized appropriately. We also show that under random perturbations caused by cross traffic described in the paper, the throughput of this reliable group communication is always larger than a positive constant, that does not depend on the group size. This scalability result, which is of independent interest, contrasts with known results about the non-scalability of IP-supported multicast for reliable group communication.

The Van Jacobson congestion control algorithm is an important and complex part of the TCP stack. It is complex because implements closed-loop control and  important since is in charge of avoiding Interent congestion collapse.

Classic (Tahoe/Reno) Van Jacobson TCP congestion control and its modifications (New Reno etc.) are based on an increasing/decreasing paradigm to probe the network capacity. The probing phase is made of a quick phase (exponential slow-start) and a gentle phase (linear congestion avoidance).

Westwood+ is to exploit the stream of returning ACK packets to estimate the capacity available for the TCP connection. The issue of e2e bandwidth estimation is an interesting one by itself and we will show that, due to ACK compression, it is necessary to employ an anti-compression procedure that plays in packet networks the role of a classic anti-aliasing filter in analog-digital signal processing. Ns-2 simulations and Linux implementations will illustrate the performace of Westwood+ TCP that results to be significantly more efficient over lossy channels, such as in the case of radio links affected by fading and shadowing. A comparison with the preformance of New Reno and Vegas TCP will be developed using computer simulations. Considering Vegas is still of interest since the new Fast TCP is, in authors words, "a high speed version of Vegas". We have found that Vegas not only is unable to coexist with Reno but alsoit is not able to use network capacity in the presence of reverse traffic , like any RTT based congestion detection algorithm. Recent experiments at SLAC Laboratory have confirmed this also for Fast TCP. To conclude we will take a look at TCP congestion control from a control theoretic perspective based on the Smith principle.

Fluctuations in network conditions are a common phenomenon. They arise in the current wired Internet due to changes in demand, and in wireless networks due to changing interference patterns. However, current congestion control design typically does not account for this, and in this sense the majority of congestion controllers proposed so far can be deemed as ``myopic''. The present work deals with the following question: how should network end-users exploit such temporal fluctuations? We introduce a formal framework, in which time diversity is explicitly described by phases in network condition. We propose as bandwidth allocation criterion the solution to an optimization problem, which features both classical (myopic) users and so-called farsighted users. We identify the corresponding farsighted user strategy as that maximizing throughput subject to a social norm related to TCP-friendliness. We establish basic desirable properties of the resulting allocations. We propose adaptive decentralized algorithms for farsighted users to achieve their target allocation. The algorithms do not require either explicit knowledge of dynamics in network conditions, or special feedback from the network.

We study an Adaptive Window Protocol (AWP) with a general increase and decrease profiles in the presence of window dependent random losses. We derive a steady-state Kolmogorov equation and then obtain its solution in analytic form. We then derive from the model some monotonicity properties of the window size process. These monotonicity properties are then used to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for stability of the window evolution process. Finally, we apply the general results to particular TCP versions such as New Reno TCP, Scalable TCP and HighSpeed TCP.

MIMD congestion control algorithm in the presence of random losses. Our approach is based on showing that the logarithm of the window size evolution has the same behaviour as the workload process in a standard G/G/1 queue.

The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the equivalent queue then provides the moments of the window size. In the second part, we study fairness among sessions sharing a common bottleneck link, where one or more sessions use a MIMD algorithm in the presence of general combination of synchronized and non-synchronized losses.

The scalability of fair queueing depends on the number of flows that have, or recently have had, packets in the queue. Applying known facts about statistical traffic characteristics at flow level, we demonstrate that this number is typically very small for any link capacity. This suggests fair queueing may be perfectly feasible, opening interesting possibilities for the development of the Internet architecture. The evaluation is based on trace simulations and an analytical traffic model. We discuss implementation considerations in the light of the derived results and point to significant outstanding issues.

Our results, based on ns-2 simulations, illustrate how A-RIO improves over RIO in terms of stabilizing the queue occupation (and, hence, queuing delay), while maintaining a high throughput and a good protection of high-priority packets; A-RIO could then be used for building controlled-delay, AF-based services. These results also provide some engineering rules that may be applied to improve the behaviour of the classical, non-adaptive RIO.

Over the past few years, the design and performance of channel-aware scheduling strategies have attracted huge interest. In the present paper we examine a somewhat different notion of scheduling, namely coordination of transmissions among base stations, which has received little attention so far. The inter-cell coordination comprises two key elements: (i) interference avoidance; and (ii) load balancing. The interference avoidance involves coordinating the activity phases of interfering base stations so as to increase transmission rates. The load balancing aims at diverting traffic from heavily-loaded cells to lightly-loaded cells. We consider a dynamic scenario where users come and go over time as governed by the arrival and completion of random data transfers, and evaluate the potential capacity gains from inter-cell coordination in terms of the maximum amount of traffic that can be supported for a given spatial traffic pattern. We also show that simple adaptive strategies achieve the maximum capacity without any explicit knowledge of the traffic characteristics. Numerical experiments demonstrate that inter-cell scheduling may provide significant capacity gains, the relative contribution from interference avoidance vs.~load balancing depending on the configuration and the degree of load imbalance in the network.

This paper analyzes the performance of a large population composed of several classes of long lived TCP flows experiencing packet losses due to random transmission errors and to congestion created by the sharing of a common tail-drop or AQM bottleneck router. Each class has a different transmission error rate. This setting is used to analyze the competition between wired and wireless users in an access network, where one class (the wired class) has no or small (like BER in DSL) transmission error losses whereas the other class has higher transmission error losses, or the competition between DSL flows using different coding schemes. We propose a natural and simple model for the joint throughput evolution of several classes of TCP flows under such a mix of losses. Two types of random transmission error losses are considered: one where losses are Poisson and independent of the rate of the flow, and one where the losses are still Poisson but with an intensity that is proportional to the rate of the source. We show that the large population model where the population tends to infinity has a threshold on the transmission error rate (given in closed form) above which there are no congestion losses at all in steady state, and below which the stationary state is a periodic congestion regime in which we compute both the mean value and the distribution of the rate obtained by each class of flow. We also show that the maximum mean value for the aggregated rate is achieved at the threshold. For the finite population model and models based on other classes of point processes, a sufficient condition is obtained for the existence of congestion times in the case of arbitrary transmission error point processes.

In this work, we study the behavior of TCP protocol over multihop ad-hoc networks. TCP is a reliable transport protocol that at first was conceived for wired networks. The congestion control mechanism of TCP is designed for wired environments and is not adapted with wireless networks such as multihop ad-hoc networks which have different characteristics in terms of loss. TCP congestion control mechanism is based on the fact that the main reason of loss in wired networks is the buffer overflow.

Through simulation, we show that TCP throughput drops significantly because it generates somewhat a "bursty" traffic that increases the contention in the MAC layer which results to collisions and packet losses.

We study the performance of several TCP connections through the bottleneck of a slow network accessed via a single queue with high capacity. Using mean-field approximation methology, we establish some asymptotical results about queue length distribution and window size distribution when the number of user increases proportionally to buffer capacity. We also give an evaluation of TCP fairness under these traffic conditions.

In this paper, we study the variation of the throughput achieved by TCP resulting from both the individual behavior of a connection and the interaction with all other connections sharing the same link. In particular, we calculate the Tail Distribution Function (TDF) of the instantaneous throughput seen by one TCP connection in the Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) framework.

Time (RTT) and under the many user approximation we prove that this TDF is given by a closed-form formula that solely depends on the network parameters (number of sources, capacity and buffer size of the bottleneck link). This formula can then be used as a dimensioning tool, where throughput is guaranteed to each user to be "larger than a given value for at least a certain percentage of the time". In the context defined here, this formula plays the same role for the dimensioning of an IP router as the Erlang B formula does for the dimensioning of a PSTN switch.

We present in this paper an analytical model for the calculation of network load and drop probabilities in a TCP/IP network with general topology. First we formulate our model as a nonlinear complementarity problem.

These equivalent formulations provide efficient computational procedures for the solution of our model. Furthermore, with the help of the fixed point formulation we are able to prove the existence of a solution. Our model has the main advantage of not requiring the pre-definition of bottleneck links.

The model also takes into account the receiver congestion window limitation. Our approach can be used for TCP/IP networks with drop tail routers as well as for TCP/IP networks with active queue management routers. We solve the problem for some network examples and we show how the distribution of load varies with network parameters. The distribution of load is sometimes counter-intuitive which cannot be detected by other models making prior assumptions on the locations of bottlenecks.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the performance of a large number of long lived TCP controlled flows sharing many routers (or links), from the knowledge of the network parameters (capacity, buffer size, topology) and of the characteristics of each TCP flow (RTT, route etc.) in the presence of synchronization. This work is based on the AIMD model which describes the joint evolution of the window sizes of all flows in the congestion avoidance phase over a single bottleneck router, in terms of iterates of random affine maps. It is shown that the generalization of this dynamics to a network composed of several routers can be described in terms of iterate of random piecewise affine maps, or geometrically as a billiards in the Euclidean space with as many dimensions as the number of flow classes and as many reflection facets as there are routers.

This can first be used as a simulation tool allowing one to emulate the interaction of millions of flows on tens of thousands of routers. This representation also leads to results of mathematical nature: this class of billiards exhibits both periodic and non-periodic asymptotic oscillations (to be interpreted as network level fluctuations for traffic aggregates), the characteristics of which are extremely sensitive to the parameters of the network; the consequences on TCP's fairness are exemplified on a few typical cases of small dimension. Finally, we also show that aggregated traffic generated by this billiards representation exhibits the same short time scale statistical properties as those observed on real traces.

Understanding the three-way statistical relationship between traffic, capacity and realized performance is vital not only for adequately provisioning IP network resources to satisfy anticipated demand but also for defining the service model and congestion control mechanisms that determine how those resources are shared. In expressing demand it is particularly important to know what set of traffic characteristics has a significant impact on performance and needs therefore to be monitored and controlled. This set clearly depends on the adopted network architecture: defined service classes, scheduling mechanisms, admission controls, traffic routing algorithms,... We argue that an essential criterion in designing the network architecture is that the resulting traffic-capacity-performance relationship be as simple as possible. In other words, resource sharing schemes should be such that performance is largely insensitive to detailed traffic characteristics.

Two resource sharing schemes which do meet the insensitivity criterion are so-called bufferless multiplexing for open-loop controlled streaming traffic and fair bandwidth sharing for closed-loop controlled elastic traffic. We review the powerful insensitivity results available for these multiplexing schemes and suggest that they indeed constitute the preferred basis for a network architecture offering guaranteed quality of service. Necessary congestion control mechanisms are described and their implementation is discussed.

We represent a data network as a set of links shared by a dynamic number of competing flows. These flows are generated within sessions and correspond to the transfer of a random volume of data on a pre-defined network route.

We use some key properties of Whittle networks to characterize the class of bandwidth allocations which are insensitive in the sense that the stationary distribution of this stochastic process does not depend on any traffic characteristics (session structure, data volume distribution) except the traffic intensity on each route. This insensitivity property presents the practical  interest of allowing the  development of robust engineering rules independently of precise traffic statistics.

We propose two novel on-line estimation algorithms to determine the size of a dynamic multicast group. We first use a Wiener filter to derive an optimal estimator for the membership size of the session in case the join process is Poisson and the lifetime of participants is distributed exponentially. We next develop the best first-order linear filter from which we derive an estimator that holds for any lifetime distribution. We apply this approach to the case where the lifetime distribution is hyperexponential. Both estimators hold under any traffic regime. Applying both estimators on real video traces, we find that both schemes behave well, one of which performs slightly better than the other in some cases.

We model short TCP transfers sharing a single bottleneck link. Our model consists of three parts. In the first part of the model we use the fixed point approach to calculate the packet loss probability in the bottleneck link. In the second part, using the fluid model approach and conditioning on the number of loss instants, we calculate the average transfer time of the TCP flows as a function of the packet loss probability and the parameters of the TCP protocol. Finally, in the third part we apply the M/G/inf model to obtain the distribution of the number of active sessions.

Our motivation is to design a traffic model for uncongested IP backbone links that is simple enough to be used in network operation, and that is protocol and application agnostic in order to be as general as possible.

Poisson shot-noise process. A flow is characterized by its arrival time, its size, its duration, and its rate function (i.e., shot). We validate the model by simulation and we analyze its accuracy with real backbone traffic traces. Despite its simplicity, our model provides a good approximation of the real traffic observed in the backbone and of its variation. We also explain how our model can be specified to the case of TCP flows. To this end, we present a model for TCP shot that only uses the size of the flow and its duration. This latter model is independent of the round-trip time and the packet loss rate.

When the queue length reaches a certain threshold RED schemes drop/mark incoming packets with a probability that increases as the queue size increases. The objectives are an equitable distribution of packet loss, reduced delay and delay variation and improved network utilization. Here we model multiple connections maintained in the congestion avoidance regime by the RED mechanism. The window sizes of each TCP session evolve like independent dynamical systems coupled by the queue length at the buffer. We introduce a mean-field approximation to one such RED system as the number of flows tends to infinity. The deterministic limiting system is described by a transport equation. The numerical solution of the limiting system is found to provide a good description of the evolution of the distribution of the window sizes, the average queue size, the average loss rate per connection and the total throughput. TCP with RED or tail-drop may exhibit limit cycles and this causes unnecessary packet delay variation and variable loss rates. The root cause of these limit cycles is the hysteresis due to the round trip time delay in reacting to a packet loss.

We propose a singular perturbation methodology for the analysis, which explits a decomposition into two time scales that characterizes RED: a fast time scale for the instantaneous throughput and queue length and a slow time scale for the variations of the averaged queue length.

Behaviour (EF PHB) as given in RFC 2598, and its impact on worst case end-to-end delay jitter. On one hand, the definition in RFC 2598 can be used to predict extremely low end-to-end delay jitter, independent of the network scale. On the other hand, we find that the worst case delay jitter can be made arbitrarily large, while each flow traverses at most a specified number of hops, if we allow networks to become arbitrarily large; this is in contradiction with the previous statement. We analyze where the contradiction originates, and find the explanation. It resides in the fact that the definition in RFC 2598 is not easily implementable in schedulers we know of, mainly because it is not formal enough, and also because it does not contain an error term.

We show that this definition implies the rate-latency service curve guarantee. Then we propose some proven bounds on delay jitter for networks implementing this new definition, both in cases without loss and with loss.

We compare policies that offer differentiated services to TCP traffic, with the goal of providing some sort of performance guarantees to a premium class of traffic.  We consider TCP connections that have been classified into separate classes and study the effectiveness of a scheduling policy combined with various buffer management policies on the performance of these competing TCP connections.

We use a stochastic model for a class-based weighted-fair-queueing scheduling policy where packets of different classes are scheduled according to their pre-assigned static weight.  We consider two buffer management policies : complete partitioning, and  complete sharing with pushout at various thresholds.

We consider two classes of TCP traffic in our results.  Our goal is to propose mechanisms with easily adjustable parameters to achieve service differentiation as required.  In the numerical results we show how the scheduling and buffer policies can be used to provide some sort of performance guarantee to the higher class.

We present an approach to analyzing the performance characteristics of TCP sessions in the presence of network routers which deploy the Random Early Detection (RED) mechanism with two "in" and "out" drop probability functions (RIO).

We consider the case with a large number of TCP sessions which use token buckets for marking "in" and "out" packets at the entrance of the network. Under some simplifying assumptions we derive a set of equations that govern the evolution of these TCP sessions and the routers under consideration. We then solve these equations numerically using a fixed point method. Our analysis can capture characteristics of both RED and Tail Drop (TD)  mechanisms in the RIO router.

Our model is validated through simulations which show that less than 5% error is achieved in most cases. Various performance analyses are then carried out using this approach in order to study the impact of the RIO parameters on the performance characteristics of TCP sessions. Our results show that the loss probability threshold of "out" packets has a significant effect on the TCP throughput and on the average queue length. Setting this parameter consists in trading off between the network utilization and the fairness among TCP connections. Our results also show that Tail Drop mechanism is particularly suitable for "in" packets to satisfy various QoS constraints.

We consider a system of identical parallel queues served by a single server and distinguished only by the price charged at entry. A Poisson stream of customers joins the queue by a greedy policy that minimizes a `disutility' that combines price and congestion. A special case of linear disutility is analyzed for which it is shown that the individually optimal greedy queue join policy is nearly socially optimal. For this queueing system, a Markov decision theoretic framework is formulated for dynamic pricing in the general case.  This queueing system has application in the pricing of Internet services.

Each week, a member of one of these three projects or an invited speaker gives a presentation of one hour, with a particular emphasis on the general problem considered and on the technics used. These seminars are intended for a large and non-specialist audience.

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was designed to provide reliable end-to-end delivery of data over unreliable networks. In practice, most TCP deployments have been carefully optimized in the context of wired networks. Ignoring the properties of wireless Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) can lead to TCP implementations with poor performance. In order to adapt TCP to MANET environment, improvements have been proposed in the literature to help TCP to differentiate between the different types of losses. Indeed, in MANETs losses are not always due to network congestion, as it is mostly the case in wired networks. In this report, we present an overview of this issue and a detailed analysis of the major factors involved. In particular, we show how TCP can be affected by mobility and lower layers protocols. In addition, we review the main proposals which aim at adapting TCP to MANET environment.

The survivability problem mentioned above consists of finding a cycle partition or covering of the edges of I with an associated routing over the graph G which should satisfy the Disjoint Routing constraint, or DR constraint, i.e :the requests involved in a cycle of the covering are routed via vertex disjoint paths (equivalently, their routings form an elementary cycle in the physical graph G).

The aim is to minimize the cost of the network; that is a very complex function depending on the size of the ADM's put in each node, the number of wavelengths (associated to the subnetworks) in transit in each optical node and a cost of regeneration and amplification of the signal.  In a first approximation, some authors reduce it to minimize the number of cycles of the covering (which is related to the problem of minimizing the number of wavelengths used and the cost of transmission); other minimize the sum of the number of vertices of the rings ; other insist on using very small cycles in the covering (short cycles are easier to manage and in case of failures, rerouting is easier). One can also want to minimize the total load (using or not shortest paths).

Kn, which corresponds to the instance of communication called total exchange or all-to-all, where each vertex wants to communicate with all the others simultaneously. In particular we have extended the result of BCY03 obtained for the physical graph Cn, a cycle of length n to a torus T(n) of size n by n BeYu06.

The Wireless Gathering Problem is to find a schedule for data gathering in a wireless static network (call scheduling).  One motivation came from the problem of designing efficient strategies to provide Internet access using wireless devices (problem asked by France Telecom).  Typically, in one village several houses wish to access a gateway (a satellite antenna) and have to use multi-hop wireless relay routing to do so.  This problem is also addressed in sensor networks where a base station has to collect data or to distribute tasks for sensor nodes.

In particular we address the problem of gathering information in a specific node (or sink) of a radio network, where interference constraints are present. We take into account the fact that, when a node transmits, it produces interference in an area bigger than the area in which its message can actually be received.  The network is modeled by a graph; a node is able to transmit one unit of information to the set of vertices at distance at most dT in the graph, but when doing so it generates interference that does not allow nodes at distance up to dI (dI ≥ dT) to listen to other transmissions.

In BCY06 and BCY06b , we consider the case dI = 1 and give algorithms and lower bounds on the minimum number of rounds for this problem, when the network is a path and the destination node is either at one end or at the center of the path. The algorithms are shown to be optimal for any dI in the first case, and for 1 ≤ dI ≤ 4, in the second case.

We are currently (with researchers in Salerno University) looking in more details at the case dI = dT = 1 where we have a polynomial algorithm in trees and hope to extend it to general graphs. this leads us to introduce the notion of gather-center of a graph.

In this problem we consider a peer-to-peer overlay network in which a set of receivers want to stream some file (media object) which is replicated and stored in different servers nodes. The file is partitioned into a large number of equal-sized chunks. Each receiver requests to receive all the chunks in order. A chunk can arrive at a receiver before the time that it is needed and will be buffered. Our main constraint is to avoid gaps between chunks.  In other words, a chunk must arrive no later than the time that the previous chunk in the sequence has been used (played back or listened to) to avoid jitter during play back. The objective is to minimize the makespan: time at which all the receivers have completed the reception of the last chunk of the sequence.

A first solution based on graph matching has been implemented with the mascopt optimization library. Experimental results proved that the critical point is the buffer space allowed at receiver nodes and we keep on working on the algorithm.

In the broadcasting problem, one node needs to broadcast a message to all other nodes in a network.  If nodes can only communicate with one neighbour at a time, broadcasting takes at least logc(N) rounds in a network of N nodes.

In the neighbourhood broadcasting problem, the node that is broadcasting only needs to inform its neighbours.  In a binary hypercube with N nodes, each node has log2(N) neighbours, so neighbourhood broadcasting takes at least log logc(N+1) rounds.  In BFPP06 we present asymptotically optimal neighbourhood broadcast protocols for binary hypercubes.

Optimization) project is to provide a set of tools for network optimization problems. Examples of problems are routing, grooming, survivability, or virtual network design. Mascopt will help implementing a solution to such problems by providing a data model of the network and the demands, libraries to handle networks and graphs, and ready to use implementation of existing algorithms or linear programs (e.g integral multicommodity flow).

Mascopt is Open Source (under LGPL) and intends to use the most standard technologies as Java Sun and XML format providing portability facilities. We finished to implement graph data structure, several basic algorithms working on graph and input/output classes. Mascopt also provides some graphical tools to display graph results.

An agent is asked to traverse a graph. He is allowed to visit every vertex more than once, but he should report every vertex exactly once. This is an easy task when the agent has enough memory, or equally, can leave an unlimited number of mark bits on the vertices of the graph. Suppose this benefit is taken from the agent. If the agent has access to no other information about the graph, then his chances to succeed are zero for general graphs. Thus, we supply some additional information to the agent and see if this increases his chances. For example, suppose the agent can use only a constant number of mark bits and suppose the graph is a geometric graph---embedded into the plane (not necessarily planar embedded) and vertices are aware of their coordinates. Does this information increase agent's chances? The answer is positive. First local traversal algorithm developed was able to traverse geometric planar triangulations. Later the algorithm was extended to traverse vertices of an arrangement or a convex polytope. The research progressed to an algorithm that can traverse any geometric planar graph.

In this talk, we extend the notion of planar graph to quasi-planar graph in which we allow many edges to cross each other. We describe an algorithm for traversal of any geometric quasi-planar graph that satisfies a simple condition. The worst case running time of our algorithm is O(|E|log|E|) which matches the running time of the traversal algorithm for planar graphs.

A k-directed-star-coloring of a digraph D is a coloring of arcs of D such that on each vertex an incoming arc has a color different from all other arcs. In this way arcs having same color form a Galaxy, a union of stars. The directed-star-arboricity of a digraph D, denoted by dst(D), is the minimum integer k for which a k-directed-star-coloring of D exists. (For instance orientations of cycles have dst = 2 apart from directed odd circuits.) This notion was defined by Guiduli and is an analog of the star-arboricity defined by Algor and Alon.

Division Multiplexing) in star optical network. We are given a star network in which a center node is connected to a set of nodes V . Each node v sends a set of s(v ) multicasts to the sets of nodes S1 (v ), . . . , Ss(v) (v ). The central node redirects an arriving message toward other vertices on the same frequency. We study the general problem of wavelength assignment in this kind of networks, taking into account the interferences.  The case of one multicast reduces to k-directed-star-coloring . If the maximum indegree is bounded by l , we prove that dst is at most 2l + 1. This is almost the best possible value as there exist digraphs with directed-star-arboricity twice the maximum indegree. For orientations of subcubic graphs, we prove dst is at most 3.

Tree-width is one of the most basic parameters in graph algorithms. There is a well established theory on the design of polynomial (or even linear) time algorithms for many intractable problems when the input is restricted to graphs of bounded tree-width. In this talk I give an overview of treewidth applications in the area of exact algorithms. The talk is based on joint work with Hans Bodlaender, Frederic Dorn,  Serge Gaspers, Kjartan Hoie,  Elko Penninkx, Saket Saurabh, and Dimitrios Thilikos.

We address such 2-dimensional packing problems as strip packing, bin packing and storage packing. These problems play an important role in many application areas, e.g. cutting stock, VLSI design, image processing, and multiprocessor scheduling. We mainly focus on the storage packing problem, that is the problem of packing weighted rectangles into a single rectangle so as to maximize the total weight of the packed rectangles. Despite the practical importance of the problem, there are just few known results in the literature. The main objective is to fill this gap and also to build the bridges to already known algorithmic solutions for strip packing and bin packing problems.

Considering natural relaxations of the storage packing problem we propose a number of efficient algorithms which are able to find solutions within a factor of (1-epsilon) of the optimum in polynomial time.

We consider approximation algorithms for non-uniform buy-at-bulk network design problems. Buy-at-bulk network design problems arise in settings where economies of scale and/or the availability of capacity in discrete units result in concave or sub-additive cost functions on the edges.

One of the main application areas is in the design of telecommunication networks. The typical scenario is that capacity (or bandwidth) on a link can be purchased in some discrete units u_1 < u_2 < ... < u_r with costs c_1 < c_2 < ... < c_r such that the cost per bandwidth decreases c_1/u_1 > c_2/u_2 > ... > c_r/u_r. The capacity units are sometimes referred to as cables or pipes. A basic problem that needs to be solved in this setting is the following: given a set of bandwidth demands, install sufficient capacity on the links of an underlying network topology so as to be able to route the demands. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

Alternatively, we can think of the following scenario. We have two independent cost functions on the links of the network: a buy cost b(e) a rent cost r(e). We are given a set of demands between some pairs of nodes.

A feasible solution for the non-uniform multicommodity buy-at-bulk instance is to buy some links and rent some other ones such that all the demands can be routed and the total cost is minimized; the cost of every bought edge is b(e) and for rented edges it is r(e) per unit of flow (bandwidth) over that link.

This problem generalizes several classical problems, such as minimum cost flow to the settings that the cost of each edge is a concave monotone function. It is known that the problem is hard to approximate within a factor of \Omega(log^{1/4-\eps} n) for any \eps>0. We give the first poly-logarithmic approximation algorithm for this problem.

A programmable overlay network goes beyond existing Grid applications, as it enables nodes to actively participate in a distributed computation as opposed to simply share their information and computational resources. In this talk we will discuss the challenges involved in programming such overlay network. These are not limited to the decentralized and distributed nature of the overlay but also involve the difficulty of orchestrating the data and computational services provided by different and heterogeneous nodes.  To this end, we claim that workflow languages can provide appropriate high level abstractions for specifying the flow linking the services provided by the nodes of the overlay. In particular, we will present JOpera, an advanced workflow tool for modeling and efficiently executing large scale distributed computations that is being extended to overlay networks in the context of the AEOLUS EU project. JOpera provides an integrated environment built on the Eclipse platform to support the whole life cycle of such overlay programs: development, execution, monitoring and debugging. A short demo will be given, showing the main features of JOpera's visual composition language and emphasizing the extensibility of JOpera's plugin-based architecture.  Among many others, JOpera's growing user community includes the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, the Swiss Bioinformatics Institute, NCSA and the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (at Purdue University).

The highly dynamic behavior of wireless networks make them very difficult to evaluate, e.g. as far as the performance of routing algorithms is concerned. However, some of them have a predictable dynamics, as the temporal variations in the network topology are somehow deterministic.

Recently, a graph theoretic model -- the evolving graphs -- was proposed to help capture the dynamic behavior of these networks, in view of the construction of least cost routing and other algorithms.

Thus we  used the NS2 network simulator to first implement an evolving graph based routing protocol, and then to evaluate such protocol compared to three major ad-hoc protocols (DSDV, DSR, AODV). Our experiments showed that evolving graphs have all the potentials to be an effective and powerful tool in the development of algorithms for dynamic networks, with predictable dynamics at least. In order to make this model widely applicable, however, some practical issues still have to be addressed and incorporated into the model, like stochastically predictable behavior and adaptive routing.

We show that the binomial tree topology is well suited for scalable deterministic and robust group management by exhibiting efficient  procedures for decentralized construction, replacement of failed elements and  routing.

Concerning particularly the communication criteria, we address the  conjecture which says that the binomial tree is the spanning tree of the  hypercube with minimum mean distance between nodes. More precisely, we exhibit a  class of transformations which can be used to prove the conjecture for small  values of n and for which the binomial tree is a local minimum for all values  of n.

Communication over the behavioral units of the model are performed by a simple communication protocol on top of TCP or UDP protocol. Basic global computers can communicate by first registering to a brokering service and then by mutually asking and offering services, in a way that is reminiscent to Rapoport's "tit-for-tat" strategy of co-operation based on reciprocity. In the model, resources are encapsulated in the intranet in which they reside, and requests for resources located in another intranet traverse a broker-2-broker negotiation using classical PKI mechanisms.  The model is suitable to fit with various global scenarios from classical PtP application, like file sharing, or band-sharing, to more sophisticated GRID application, like remote and distributed big (and small) computations, to possible, futuristic real migrating computations.

Much work has gone into finding nontrivial upper bounds on the chromatic number of a graph based on other graph invariants.  Reed conjectured that in fact $\chi(G) \leq \lceil (1/2)(\Delta+\omega+1) \rceil$ and proved that the bound holds for the fractional chromatic number, even without the round-up.  I will discuss the proof of Reed's Conjecture, as it is widely known, for the class of line graphs.  I will also briefly mention some recent work on Reed's Conjecture for the class of quasi-line graphs.

We discuss how random walks can be used to analyze random graphs. We tie down the expected diameter of the random minimum weight spanning tree of a complete graph with i.i.d weights. This is joint work with Broutin and Reed. It answers a question of Frieze and McDiarmid.

The minimum cost homomorphism problem generalises as diverse problems as chromatic numbers, maximum independent set, list homomorphism, and many more. We will also give some other motivation why this is an interesting problem, such as applications in military logistics. We will then discuss a dichotomy of the minimum cost homomorphism problems for graphs H, with and without loops allowed.  In fact if  each connected component of H is either a reflexive proper interval graph or an irreflexive proper interval bigraph, then the MinHOMP(H) is polynomial time solvable. In all other cases the MinHOMP(H) is NP-hard.

We will also state and discuss results for minimum cost homomorphisms in directed graphs. No dichotomy is yet known for directed graphs, but several partial results are known. We finally state some open problems.

Bodlaender and Fomin, after having proved that the pathwidth of every biconnected outerplanar graph is always at most twice the pathwidth of its (geometric) dual plus two, conjectured that there exists a constant c such that the pathwidth of every biconnected outerplanar graph is at most c plus the pathwidth of its dual. They also conjectured that this was actually true with c being 1 for every biconnected planar graph. Fomin proved that the second conjecture is true for all planar triangulations.  First, we construct for each p>0 a biconnected outerplanar graph of pathwidth 2p+1 whose (geometric) dual has pathwidth p+1, thereby disproving both conjectures.

The explosive growth of Web-related services over the Internet is bringing millions of new users online, thus fueling an enormous demand for bandwidth. Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) networks, employing wavelength routing have emerged as the dominant technology to satisfy this growing demand for bandwidth.

As the amount of traffic carried has increased, any single failure can be catastrophic. Survivability becomes indispensable in such networks. Therefore, it is imperative to design networks that can quickly and efficiently recover from failures. Most research to date in survivable optical network design and operation focuses on single link failures, however, the occurrence of multiple-link failures are not uncommon in a network topology. Multi-link failure scenarios can arise out of two common situations. First, an arbitrary link may fail in the network, and before that link can be repaired, another link fails, thus creating a multi-link failure sequence. Secondly, it might happen in practice that two distinct physical links may be routed via the same common duct or physical channel. A failure at that shared physical location creates a logical multiple-link failure. Such instances where separate fiber optic links share a common failure structure is often referred to as SRLG (Shared-Risk Link Groups).

In this dissertation, we study survivability paradigms for surviving multiple link failures. We study the network design and upgrade problem in WDM backbone networks and formulate it using a simulated annealing based technique. This framework provides a cost effective way of upgrading the network by identifying how much resources to budget at each stage of network evolution. This results in significant cost reductions for the network service provider.

We study protection reconfiguration using two different survivability paradigms, namely sub-graph routing and shared mesh protection. Initially sub-graphs are defined taking into account link, SRLG, or node failures, and could, in the event of an unrelated or subsequent multi-link failure, incorporate the reactive form of sub-graph fault tolerance. Reactive sub-graph fault tolerance employs a recursive approach for tolerating numerous sequential overlapping failures. It can tolerate simultaneous multiple link failures by simply serializing the handling of each individual fault.

Connection re-routing and network reconfiguration is one of the primary challenges in sub-graph routing methodology. We propose a constrained subgraph routing methodology, which restricts the connections to be routed using the same trunk and channel in the subgraphs, thus minimizing reconfiguration. The subgraph based routing methodology is further explored to tolerate multiple link failures, in the form of shared-risk link groups and node failures.

The generalized diverse routing problem, for finding two diverse routes between a source and destination have been shown to be NP-Complete. Recent studies have also proven the NP-completeness of the SRLG diverse routing. We propose a polynomial time graph transformation algorithm for solving the diverse routing problem for certain specific SRLG's, which includes link-sets incident on a common node. The proposed graph transformation methodology for diverse routing, is also studied for shared-risk node group (SRNG) failures.

We study the problem of gathering information from the nodes of a radio network into a central destination node.  A transmission can be received by a node if it is sent from a distance of at most dT and there is no interference from other transmissions.  One transmission interferes with the reception of another transmission if the sender of the first transmission is at distance dI or less from the receiver of the second transmission.  In this lecture we study the case dT=1 and dI > 1 for paths and two-dimensional grid networks with unit time transmissions.

First we consider the problem of exploration of trees, some of whose edges are faulty. An agent, situated in a starting node and unaware of the location of faults, has to explore the connected fault-free component of this node by visiting all its nodes. We interested in a fastest exploration, i.e. minimizing the number of edge traversals.

Another scenario is a graph with a black hole.  A black hole is a highly harmful stationary process residing in a node of a network and destroying all mobile agents visiting the node, without leaving any trace.  We consider the task of locating a black hole in a (partially) synchronous network, assuming an upper bound on the time of any edge traversal by an agent. The minimum number of agents capable to identify a black hole is two. For a given graph and given starting node we are interested in the fastest possible black hole search by two agents.

We introduce and study so-called track layouts of graphs. A relationship between this combinatorial structure and several well-known types of graph layouts is established. For example, our study of track layouts of bounded treewidth graphs settles an open problem due to Ganley and Heath (2001) regarding queue layouts of such graphs. Moreover, the study also establishes that graphs of bounded treewidth have three-dimensional straight-line grid drawings with linear volume, which represents the largest known class of graphs with such drawings.

We show that the edges of any graph G can be weighted with integers from {1,...,30} so that, for each edge (u,v), the sum of the weights on edges incident to u is different from the sum of the weiths on edges incident to v. In other words, the edge weights induce a proper vertex coloring of G. We also explore some degree-constrained subgraph problems which arise in the proof, and some more general problems of when subgraphs with specified vertex degrees can be found.

Some of the first routing algorithms for geographically aware wireless networks used the Delaunay triangulation among the network's nodes as the underlying connectivity graph. These solutions were considered impractical, however, because in general the Delaunay triangulation may contain arbitrarily long edges, and because calculating the Delaunay triangulation generally requires a global view of the network. Many other algorithms were then suggested for geometric routing, often assuming random placement of network nodes for analysis or simulation. We show that, when the nodes are uniformly placed in the unit disk, the Delaunay triangulation does not contain long edges, it is easy to compute locally and it is in many ways optimal for geometric routing and flooding.

Prosit is new Object-Oriented framework for discrete event simulation currently in development in our team. With Prosit, the simulationist builds his model using dedicated class libraries and user-defined classes. Without code modification, the simulation can be executed in a sequential or distributed (in both optimistic and conservative variants) way.

With techniques such as reification (reification transforms a call issued to an object into an object itself), we do not only use the Object-Oriented features (overloading, inheritance, etc.) to build Prosit but we also use the mechanisms supporting the Object-Oriented paradigm.

To improve the performance, the samples are buffered on a data stream basis. The buffer size  can be modified by the programmer and is  a compromise based on the frequency of result requests, the network overhead and the processing time of each sample.

QNAP2 (Queuing Networks Analysis Package) is a commercial package distributed by Simulog S.A that allows the performance analysis of queuing networks by analytical and simulation methods. Its Parallel Replications extension, developed by  the SLOOP team, uses PVM3 to run several instances of the same model in parallel. Statistical results are then gathered and combined.

MPCFS stands for MultiPoint Communication File System. Based upon a virtual file system (it only exists in the kernel's memory and has no real/physical support), this new filesystem provide its users a powerful way of achieving multi-point communications using very simple file operations. In short, it defines a new kind of named pipes through which a process may broadcast data across the network to every others process reading the other end of the pipe.

Processes (un)register to a communication group by writing the name of that group in the register file (+grp_name to register,-grp_name to unregister). Depending on the configuration parameters of the file system (as set by the host admisnistrator), this registration may fail or succeed.

Each directory of this multiplexing hierachy (including the process directory itself) contains the special file (namely chan) used by the processes to send (write) or receive (read) messages. The point here is that a message sent through a given chan file in the hierarchy can only be read from an image chan file, appearing exactly at the same place (ie same path) in the receiver's multiplexing hierarchy.

This hierarchy is thus an elegant way for the sending processes to attach tags to their messages and for the receiving processes to select (or discard) messages according to theses tags, by just creating and/or deleting directories in their hierarchy.

Notice that multiplexing also provides a powerfull multicasting mechanism, since messages transmitted through a given multiplexing path are only delivered to the other processes defining that multiplexing path.

Every group directory has one. This is the place where the pending messages are stored for all the processes belonging to the group. The directory tree that appears under this spool directory is a compound tree of all the multiplexing hierarchies of the group members.

This is a special file appearing in each group directory. Process join their local group to remote ones (having the same name) by writing the name of the remote machine in that file. As soon as such a request succeeds (the remote machine hosts a group having the same name and the local and remote configurations of the groups both allow such an association), the message locally written in the group are transmitted to the remote host's group. On the other side, any message written by a remote process in the group from that moment is received and spooled in the local group.

This special file is most important: it the one processes read or write to receive or send their messages. As with any file, the process may configure it (using a ioctl call) to be either synchronous or asynchronous (ie blocking or non-blocking).

The next link is a symbolic link appearing in a process multiplexing directory when at least one message is pending for this process, in this directory. It points in the spool tree to the file containing the first pending message (the next to be read through the chan file) for this process in this directory.

I started thinking about it by the end of 1996, while discovering the many interesting features of the Linux procfs. Kernel hacking was quite new for me, so I decided to look for some help. I submitted the project of writing a first prototype for Linux to the neighbouring Computer Science Engineering School (ESSI) as a case study for last year engineer trainees.

By now (March 1998), the local part of the Linux driver (ie communications between multiple processes running on the same host) is quite stable. The networking part is still under development but it is nearly complete.

Inline function expansion is an optimization that may improve program performance by removing calling sequences and enlarging the scope of other optimizations. Unfortunately it also has the drawback of enlarging programs. This might impair executable programs performance. In order to get rid of this annoying effect, we present, an easy to implement, inlining optimization that minimizes code size growth by combining a compile-time algorithm deciding when expansion should occur with different expansion frameworks describing how they should be performed. We present the experimental measures that have driven the design of inline function expansion. We conclude with measurements showing that our optimization succeeds in producing faster codes while avoiding code size increase.

In this paper we present a new program analysis method which we call Storage Use Analysis. This analysis deduces how objects are used by the program and allows the optimization of their allocation. This analysis can be applied to both statically typed languages (e.g. ML) and latently typed languages (e.g. Scheme). It handles side-effects, higher order functions, separate compilation and does not require CPS transformation. We show the application of our analysis to two important optimizations: stack allocation and unboxing. The first optimization replaces some heap allocations by stack allocations for user and system data storage (e.g. lists, vectors, procedures). The second optimization avoids boxing some objects. This analysis and associated optimizations have been implemented in the Bigloo Scheme/ML compiler. Experimental results show that for many allocation intensive programs we get a significant speedup. In particular, numerically intensive programs are almost 20 times faster because floating point numbers are unboxed and no longer heap allocated.

Over 25 implementations of different functional languages are benchmarked using the same program, a floating-point intensive application taken from molecular biology. The principal aspects studied are compile time and execution time for the various implementations that were benchmarked. An important consideration is how the program can be modified and tuned to obtain maximal performance on each language implementation. With few exceptions, the compilers take a significant amount of time to compile this program, though most compilers were faster than the then current GNU C compiler (GCC version 2.5.8). Compilers that generate C or Lisp are often slower than those that generate native code directly: the cost of compiling the intermediate form is normally a large fraction of the total compilation time. There is no clear distinction between the runtime performance of eager and lazy implementations when appropriate annotations are used: lazy implementations have clearly come of age when it comes to implementing largely strict applications, such as the Pseudoknot program. The speed of C can be approached by some implementations, but to achieve this performance, special measures such as strictness annotations are required by non-strict implementations. The benchmark results have to be interpreted with care. Firstly, a benchmark based on a single program cannot cover a wide spectrum of `typical' applications. Secondly, the compilers vary in the kind and level of optimisations offered, so the effort required to obtain an optimal version of the program is similarly varied.

Included in a compiler for functional or object oriented languages, inline function expansion has been reported as one of the most valuable optimizations. Unfortunately, it has an important counterpart: since it duplicates function body, it enlarges the code of the compiled programs as well as the resulting object code. The main contribution of this paper is to present a simple compile time inlining decision algorithm where the code length increasing factor is a constant that can be tuned by the compiler designer and where execution improvements are comparable with other previous sophisticated technics. Our major concern is about functional languages. With these languages, recursive functions are widely used: the second contribution of this paper is the presentation of an original ad hoc inlining framework for recursive functions which is more accurate than function unfolding. Experimental results demonstrate that our inlining technics succeed in producing small and efficient compiled object codes.

We present Bigloo, a highly portable and optimizing compiler. Bigloo is the first compiler for strict functional languages that can efficiently compile several languages: Bigloo is the first compiler for full Scheme and full ML, and for these two languages, Bigloo is one of the most efficient compiler now available (Bigloo is available by anonymous ftp at http://www.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Bigloo). This high level of performance is achieved by numerous high-level optimizations. Some of those are classical optimizations adapted to higher-order functional languages (e.g. inlining), other optimization schemes are specific to Bigloo (e.g. a new refined closure analysis, an original optimization of imperative variables, and intensive use of higher-order control flow analysis). All these optimizations share the same design guideline: the reduction of heap allocation.

We present a new Caml compiler, which was obtained by an original approach: a simple pipeline between two existing compilers, each one devoted to half of the compilation process. The first compiler is a Caml compiler, it is in charge of the front end, and ensures compatibility. The second compiler is an optimizing Scheme compiler, it constitutes the back end, and ensures efficiency. These are camlc 0.6 byte-code compiler and a Scheme compiler (Bigloo). Using this technology, we were able to write the optimizing compiler in only two man-months. The new compiler is bootstrapped, fully compatible with the camlc compiler, and features interesting inter-module optimizations for curried functions. It produces efficient code, comparable with the one produced by other ML compilers (including SML/NJ). Our new compiler, Bigloo, is freely available at http://www.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Bigloo.

The Bee is an integrated development environment for the Scheme programming language. It provides the user with a connection between Scheme and the C programming language, a symbolic debugger, a profiler, an interpreter, an optimizing compiler that delivers stand alone executables, a source file browser, a project manager, user libraries and online documentation. This article details the facilities of the Bee, its user interface and presents an overview of the implementation of its main components.

This paper introduces the concepts of wide classes and widening as extensions to the object model of class-based languages such as Java and Smalltalk. Widening allows an object to be temporarily widened, that is transformed into an instance of a subclass, a wide class, and, later on, to be shrunk, that is reshaped to its original class. Wide classes share the main properties of plain classes: they have a name, a superclass, they may be instantiated, they have an associated class predicate and an associated type that may be used to override function definitions. Widening is also useful to implement transient data storage for long-lasting computations. In particular, it helps reducing software data retention. This phenomenon arises when the actual data structures used in a program fail to reflect time-dependent properties of values and can cause excessive memory consumption during the execution. Wide classes may be implemented for any dynamically-typed class-based programming language with very few modifications to the existing runtime system. We describe the simple and efficient implementation strategy used in the Bigloo runtime system.

The rapid growth of computer networks has created an opportunity for developing massively distributed computer systems. Such systems will likely consist of loose communities of heterogeneous machines running different operating systems with different security policies. The challenge is to design a reliable, and yet efficient, infrastructure trustworthy enough for electronic commerce and flexible enough to allow software upgrades as well as new functionality to propagate in a decentralized, inherently insecure, wide area network. Mobile object systems embody a paradigm where computations, i.e. running programs, may move across the network and carry out truly distributed computations. The vision is that computations structured as autonomous systems of objects will roam the network performing complex tasks on the behalf of their human owner. These mobile systems of objects carry their data as well as their code with them during their journey, thus allowing almost unlimited extendability. Such unfettered mobility raises justified security concerns. From the host's stand point first. Can an arbitrary code fragment be entrusted with local resources? To what degree is it possible to control the behaviour of downloaded code? How can secrecy and integrity be preserved? From the sender's stand point next. Is it possible to entrust the network with mobile computations that encode valuable knowledge and are empowered to carry out commercial transactions? Even though it is technically feasible to charge foreign computations for small service such as execution time or storage. The key question whether there is a way to achieve a sufficient level of security for this approach to be viable? Currently, we must answer by the negative. None of the existing mobile computation systems meet the security requirements of electronic commerce. Lack of security fosters a just say no attitude towards mobile computations in portions of the scientific and business community. The proverbial ball is now in the camp of mobile computations research. It is up to us to demonstrate that mobile objects may meet the stringent security criteria of real world applications. The main contribution of this chapter is the study of security threats inherent to communication in mobile object systems. We will study how mobile object systems communicate. Describe the dangers of traditional communication mechanisms and outline two research directions currently being investigated.

Threads are executed in their order of creation, one at a time, each cooperating   with the others to let them execute too. Execution time is divided in abstract time slices called instants. Each instant ends when all threads are blocked.

LURC has a deterministic scheduler: this means that the scheduling of a given program will be the same at every execution. This helps a lot in figuring out what your program does, and at reproducing bugs related to thread synchronisation.

Synchronous Copy: this is the default type of thread, it is purely cooperative and they all share a common stack, which is saved and restored when cooperating. Memory usage for each thread is minimal, this is recommended for threads with a small stack usage.

Synchronous Jump: another purely cooperative thread, but they each have their own separate stack. Memory usage depends on the initial stack size, but is usually higher, while cooperation time is fastest. This type is recommended for threads with a high stack usage.

Asynchronous Lock: cooperative threads which can become asynchronous and free from the scheduler at run-time, and of course they can become synchronous again later on. This is based on PThreads, where each thread uses PThread locks when cooperative in order to cooperate. This type of thread is recommended for threads which are mainly asynchronous.

Asynchronous Jump: another thread which can become asynchronous, but when it is cooperative, its underlying PThread is sleeping, thus yielding the same performance as the Synchronous Jump type when cooperating. This is recommended for threads which are mainly synchronous.

As you can see, each thread has its own distinct implementation and advantages, and they can all run next to one another, so it's up to the programmer to find the thread type most suited to each thread.

Signals   are the main communication means in LURC. They are objects that can have two states: unemitted and emitted. Every signal starts each instant in its unemitted state, until a thread emits it, which changes its state to emitted until the next instant.

The first is when you want to cooperate (or you want to wait for a signal) in the middle of a critical section. The second is when you're not a cooperative thread! This happens of course if a thread is detached and becomes asynchronous.

Threads can enter special control blocks called suspension blocks, which will suspend the execution of the block whenever a given signal is not emitted. This means the block will start every instant suspended, waiting for the signal to be emitted, which will then allow the block to resume execution until at most the end of the instant.

Threads can enter special control blocks called preemption blocks, which will execute the block normally, but will terminate it at the end of the first instant where a given signal is emitted. This serves as a try/catch block in which exceptions are signals and can thus be emitted by any thread.

Threads can enter special control blocks called protection blocks, composed of two parts: the protected block and the protector block. The principle is that the protected block will be executed normally, and when that block either terminates, or is preempted, the protector block will be executed. When the protector block has terminated, if the protected block terminated normally, the protection block terminates, and if the protector block was preempted, preemption is resumed upwards.

The three control block features can be used either as a library function, by passing pointers to the function blocks as parameters, or can be used inline, using GCC macros   to generate nested functions in order to call those library functions and still capture the local environment.

LURC threads always start in a cooperative state, but it is possible to create LURC threads which can become asynchronous when needed, and return to synchronous cooperative scheduling whenever they want.

Preliminary for Thread-Specific Data is included in LURC, which allows each thread to have a pointer to a data area that is specific to this thread alone. An example of how to extend it to have PThread-like TSD is included here, but is not the default, since doing TSD with Hash Tables can be preferred in some situations, which LURC lets you do.

Since it seems to be a strongly unwritten guideline as far as personnal pages are concerned, I'll expose my main areas of interest and bash at things I barely understand while exposing my unquestionably objective enthousiasm at other things.

Back then, people understood one another. There was only One Language, yet it was so rich that everything could be expressed in It, and everything was great and people were both happy and rich (that was people needed Viagra and the great spam plague over Egypt).

Then something went *clik* *wagum-wagum* and the great cogwheel of cognition broke down in flames. At least it is believed it went like that. In any case, new languages started to appear at the time. Things like Scheme, Java, or even that disease of a crippled dialect used for this website: PHP.

You can probably think of these languages as specialized, trimmed-down versions of the Original Language. At least that's how I look at it. And most people that know the One and Only Language. Others seem to be missing the point, and reason the other way around. They take one perfectly objective argument I have against, say, Scheme, turn it around, and complain about the opposite against Perl. Which is perfect nonsense, as we all know.

OK, so I love Perl, the fact that you can program in any style you want, always have the operators and functions you need, the libraries are all there and available easily, and it's actually documented.

Mostly to remind me how painful my experience in C++ was. I think you have to know all of the gore details of how C++ works to realize that there are about 70% of it you should avoid at all costs. Mind you, I do think It's a good superset of C, but a terribly dangerous, treacherous and useless superset of Java.

Manuel Serrano when I met him back in University. I said almost because I actually programmed quite often in Emacs-Lisp (for reasons I can't begin to fathom now that I forgot how good they were at the time), and loved learning Common-Lisp to pass an exam required to re-enter University some years ago.

I've literally read pages of ML these last months without even beginning to have the faintest idea how you actually write (or read, for that matter) a program. I'm sure there is some good justification of this, and it's all clear and a great language, but it's certainly not good for self-teaching (which is probably fine, as I'm sure it was also not made for that).

Now, XEmacs has my philosophical favour over Emacs because of the person at the head of it (and, irconically, out of its own). I just hate extremists, and narrow-minded people, that's one if I've ever seen any. As for features, honestly, both are equal. Of course, I consider Eclipse to be a very fine editor for whatever language it supports, probably better than whatever IDE features Emacs tries to mock, and certainly better than whatever Vim does not have as far as IDE is concerned. The only thing keeping me from using it is that the E in IDE is not Editor, and I do need more editor features (super-duper shortcults for all sorts of complex text actions) than language-specific features. The best would be of course to have them all, but it's not the case yet, so I'll stick with what I favour.

Well, I use Linux everywhere I use a computer. If silly product vendors force me to use Windows I do, swearing under my breadth. But there's one thing I don't do: proclaim Linux is the best for everyone (take that you silly bigots).

I know why I prefer Linux over Windows or Macs, but I also understand why other people prefer something else. That and the fact I actually prefer to have the most helpless people and prone to come crying at me on their knees, begging for help fixing their computer, to have these people use an OS I can honestly say I have absolutely no clue how to use, and even less fix.

Traditionally the Workshop is an open forum, with a loose schedule agenda and no prior talk selection. It is the yearly meeting point of experts in the field of synchronous reactive formalisms, but also gladly welcomes other researchers from neighbouring areas, or even just wishing to make closer connections with their research domains.

Reactive Programming considers software systems whose behaviors basically consist in reacting to activations. These systems are often called reactive systems. System reactions, also called instants, can take various forms, for example sequences of successive phases, or oscillations eventually leading to stabilization. Reactive Programming put the focus on the semantics and the programming of such systems.

The considered systems are made of concurrent components running in parallel. In the reactive approach, components share the same instants which thus define a kind of global logical clock: components synchronize at each end of instant and a new instant can only take place when all components have finished their execution for the current instant.

Concurrent components can communicate and synchronize using broadcast events. Like in radio transmissions, all components instantaneously receive the same information. Indeed, no receptor can miss a generated event and reception occurs in the instant of generation.

The synchronous approach, from which reactive programming is issued, considers, as opposite to reactive programming, that instants take no time. A variant of the Esterel synchronous programming language, called SL, has been defined and implemented with Reactive-C.

ROM model (Reactive Object Model). In this model, objects run reactive behaviors and communicate by method calls which are processed at the instant they are issued. The extension to distribution of the model, called DROM, basically introduces the notion of a synchronized area in which all reactive objects share the same logical clock, while distinct synchronized areas run asynchronously.

Graphical reactive programming is provided by Icobjs systems. An icobj has a icon part and a behavior part. In Icobjs programming, the user does not write code but instead combines icons at screen to create new icobjs.

Java classes SugarCubes and Junior. These formalisms define reactive instructions as Java objects run by reactive machines. Moreover, REJO is a programming language which extends Java for reactive programming. It is used to program intelligent reactive agents in the dedicated ROS platform.

FairThreads API.  Variants of it are implemented in Java, Scheme, and C.  The LOFT language for reactive concurrent programming in C is based on FairThreads. It allows users to decompose systems in synchronized areas and to mix preemptive and cooperative threads.

The basic idea of Reactive-C was to propose a programming style close to C, in which program behaviors are defined in terms of reactions to activations. Reactive-C programs can react differently when activated for the first time, for the second time, and so on. Thus a new dimension appears for the programmer: the logical time induced by the sequence of activations, each pair of activation/reaction defining one instant.

The first formalism implemented in Reactive-C is NRP (Nets of Reactive Processes). In this formalism, programs are made of reactive processes executed in parallel and communicating through unbounded first-in/first-out files called channels.

Reactive processes are sequential reactive programs which can put messages in their output channels, and get messages from their input channels. The key point is that a process which tries to get a message from an empty channel does not remain stuck forever on the channel: reactive processes can test for channel emptyness. Because all processes share the same notion of an instant, nets of reactive processes are deterministic.

The NRP model is actually an extension of the Kahn model, introduced in 1974, which allows processes to test channels for emptyness, while preserving determinism. The test for channel emptyness gives NRP a more expressive power than Kahn's networks. For example, it becomes possible to reset a process when it receives a message on a priority channel, which was not possible in Kahn's model.

The SL language is a member of the family of synchronous languages in which reactions are instantaneous. The syntax is close to Esterel, but in SL hypotheses about signal presence/absence are disallowed. One decides that a signal is absent during an instant only at the end of this instant, so, reaction to the absence is delayed to the next instant.

Sources of causal circularities (the so-called causality cycles) are avoided, while the main features of the synchronous approach still remain: the expressive simplicity and power of the parallel instruction, the ease of specification and debugging for deterministic programs, and the power and modularity of event broadcasting. However, "strong" preemption is not possible in SL, which only allows the "weak" one.

The Reactive Object Model (ROM) merges an object approach with the notion of a global instant. In this model, methods can be invoked using instantaneous non-blocking send orders which are immediately processed (that is, processed during the current instant). Moreover, a method cannot execute more than once at each instant. The semantics of ROM has been studied in cooperation with Cosimo Laneve from Bologna University (Italy).

Reactive Scripts are programs intended to be run by reactive interpretors. Reactive scripts interpretors can run several commands in parallel and manage broadcast events. Instants of reactive scripts are actually identified to the reactions of the interpretor. The Language of Reactive Scripts is a mix of two formalisms: the SL synchronous language, and the ROM model.

A Reactive Scripts interpretor called rsi-tk has been implemented in Reactive-C, using the graphical toolkit Tcl/Tk as interpretor of basic actions. An interpretor of Reactive Scripts has also been developped by Jean-Ferdy Susini with SugarCubes.

Icobj Programming is a simple and fully graphical programming method, using a powerful means to combine behaviors. This programming is based on the notion of an icobj which has a behavioral aspect (object part), a graphical aspect (icon part), and which can be animated at screen.

A comparison of SugarCubes with the standard Java threading mechanism is available. It shows that SugarCubes proposes a simple and structured approach to concurrency which can be seen as an alternative to Java threads, especially when dynamic combinations of communicating concurrent components are needed.

Junior is a kernel model for reactive programming, issued froom SugarCubes. It basically defines concurrent reactive instructions communicating with broadcast events. At the basis of Junior is the rejection of immediate reaction to absence, which is one of the major difference with synchronous formalisms.

Junior has an efficient implementation in which the whole program has not to be walked through at each micro-step. In this implementation, developped by Laurent Hazard, instructions stuck on events are stored in queues, and generation of an event directly fires all instructions stuck on it. Others implementations have been developped in various contexts; one of them is under construction by Louis Mandel.

REJO isv an extension of Java that defines reactive objects having their own data and their own set of reactive instructions. These objects might also be considered as mobile agents which can migrate using a platform, named ROS, based on JavaRMI.

Scheme. Implementations differ by the way unlinked threads are defined. In Scheme, unlinked threads, called service threads, are not user-defined.  In Java and C, unlinked threads are mapped to kernel threads and programming constructs are provided for dynamically linking and unlinking threads.

Cellular automata (CA) are used in various simulation contexts, for example, physical simulations, fire propagation, or artificial life. These simulations basically consider large numbers of small-sized identical components, called cells, with local interactions and a global synchronized evolution.

Reactive programming (RP) basically considers software systems made of concurrent components sharing the same global instants. In RP, all components are running at the same pace as they necessarily synchronize at the end of each instant. The existence of instants allows one to define broadcast events which are a powerful mean for modular programming.

Modularity of programming. The behaviors of cells is rather opaque in usual CA implementations. This is however generally not felt as a big issue because cells behaviors are often very simple. In some contexts, for example artificial life, one may ask for more complex cell behaviors. In these cases, modularity is certainly a plus.

Multiprocessing. Sequential programming of CA makes difficult the use of several processors because cells must be protected from concurrent accesses of their neighbors and because the global synchronization of cells has to be preserved. The proposed concurrent implementation of CA is compatible with multiprocessing.

One gets an efficient implementation in which cells are threads created when needed. Cell behaviors are coded at a higher level than the one of look-up tables. The example of self-replicating loops is considered,  following the work of Langton and Sayama in artificial life.

Many interesting systems in physics consist of linked entities. Continuous system dynamics can be described by, possibly large, systems of differential equations. Here we consider the ordinary differential equations. Often a system does not have an exact analytical solution (non-linear differential equations) so a numerical solution is the best available. Two main phases are : discretization of time and then integration using, for example, some stepwise methods (iterative algorithms).

Notwithstanding simulation of pure continuous and pure discrete systems is well-understood, the building of initial models and their numerical resolution can become very complicated, especially when modeling of mixed continuous/discret behavior (hybrid phenomena) is needed.

Here we present some examples of application of the reactive approach in modeling and simulation of continuous (and hybrid) phenomena. This technique gives a very simple and modular way to describe the evolution of complex physical models. The main features of this approach are simplicity of model construction and high modularity of components. This approach allows to express both continuous and discret aspects of a model.

The aim of the reactive approach is to propose a structured and flexible paradigm for programming dynamic reactive systems. A reactive system is composed of a set of synchronously executed parallel components communicating by instataneous broadcast events (communication is similar to the radio transmission where emitters send information that is instantaneously received by all listeners). The model proceeds in successive reactions, one at each logical instant. At each instant, the reaction is computed using the current tuple of input events and some internal information. The global behavior of such a system results from the cooperation of its components (subsystems).

A reactive program plays the role of an independent logical process describing a behavior of an entity and operating on its associated state (which can be incapsulated in an appropriate logical object). Implementations exist on C and Java and provide a set of basic primitives (sequential and parallel execution, preemption, reaction on events, loops, conditions) with clear and precise semantic rules. Reactive machines execute the reactive instructions and allow to dynamically add and remove (to preempt) the components and theirs programs from the environment of execution.

Using the synchronous execution, a complex system can be represented as a set of linked but independent entities with a common discret time (instants). Linkage translates into events (for example, forces between particles), thus the model is very modular : adding new receivers to the system is totally transparent and does not affect the functionality of the other components.

We can adapt many of the numerical algorithms of integration that are in standard use by mapping theirs steps onto the logical instants. Thus, one can simulate a complex physical system in very natural way by simply putting many reactive objects in parallel, that means that we have many parallel synchronized processes of integration communicating by broadcast events. Each process can be controled and preempted as well as new components can be dynamically added in the system without any global reinitialization.

Let's bring a simple example of the implementation of the principles mentioned above. The first image shows general block-function diagram of any component. Central block corresponds to a system of differential equations (for example, coupled equations for newtonian motion). The input entries are received events and the output events (g vector) are some functions depending on the value of the state vector (let's call them influences). Input and output entries of all the components are synchronized in a natural way.

The second image is a possible general schemes of reactive program of components corresponding to one step of calculation (the body of the main loop). It can be composed of three main parts : emission of influences, reception and collection of external influences and computation of the next state (or of a next estimation) using some of the simpler numerical methods (we use Euler, Verlet and Runge-Kutta4 methods). This program is self-starting.

The Icobj package provides two powerfull mechanisms : visual representation of reactive objects and dynamical graphical construction of theirs behaviors from basic elementary behaviors (as "move right", "move up", "attract", "bounce", etc). One can consider this package (with some extensions) as a low-level block diagram simulator.

Here you can find some examples of use of this approach (based on a simple web-version of Icobj framework). There are only some predefined ready-to-use configurations, however you can construct your own simulations with web-version (soon available here).

Bigloo is mostly R5RS compliant. It supports multiple values by the means of call-with-values, values and the extra form multiple-value-bind, hygienic macros let-syntax, syntax-rules, ..., eval with environment, and dynamic protections (dynamic-wind).

Java code and Bigloo code can be merged together. Bigloo functions can call Java functions and vice-versa, Bigloo code can use and instantiate Java classes. Bigloo functions and variables can hold Java values (Java classes values). Bigloo data structures can point to Java data structures and vice-versa.

C code and Bigloo code can be merged together. Bigloo functions can call C functions and vice-versa, Bigloo code can use C global variables and vice-versa. Bigloo functions and variables can hold C values (C types values). C values can be allocated from Bigloo program and vice-versa, Bigloo data structures can point to C data structures and vice-versa.

Clos-like generic functions. Bigloo uses single inheritance and mono-dispatch. Futhermore, the Bigloo's object system includes introspection facilities. Classes are able to deliver access and mutation functions to their instance's fields.

Fair threads can communicate using broadcast events. Their semantics does not depends on the executing platform. Fine control over fair threads execution is possible allowing the programming of specific user-defined scheduling strategies.

Bigloo discourages the use of call/cc. Instead it proposes dynamic exceptions a la Common Lisp (by the means of three constructions: try that catches errors, bind-exit that binds an exception and unwind-protect that protects a piece of code from exceptions).

Bigloo programs may contain type annotations. Bigloo programs are encouraged to contain type annotations. Type annotations hold on variables, function parameters and function results. Type annotations help the compiler in the task of the static type mismatch detection and help it at producing more efficient code.

An effort has been started to improve the standard library so that errors are signaled with exceptions. For instance, the reader now raises &io-read-errors instead of invoking ERROR. Only a subset of the library is currently using RAISE.

IA64 that needs special code sequence before saving and restoring a stack. This needs check on Sparc because I have simplified the handling of windows registers. The prototype of PUSH_EXIT has changed.

When the value stored in an object slot was a procedure the type of the slot was not checked! That is, it was possible to store a procedure in a slot typed integer. This compiler error was apt to produce "runtime bus error".

Bigloo include file. The multiple inclusion is based on file name so it is still possible that a file is included several time if it is not referenced to by the same name. In addition a new compiler option (-multiple-inclusion) enables multiple inclusions.

This high level of performance is achieved by numerous high-level optimizations. Some of those are classical optimizations adapted to higher-order functional languages (e.g. inlining), other optimization schemes are specific to Bigloo (e.g. a new refined closure analysis, an original optimization of imperative variables, and intensive use of higher-order control flow analysis). All these optimizations share the same design guideline: the reduction of heap allocation.

Widening is also useful to implement transient data storage for long-lasting computations. In particular, it helps reducing software data retention. This phenomenon arises when the actual data structures used in a program fail to reflect time-dependent properties of values and can cause excessive memory consumption during the execution.

Wide classes may be implemented for any dynamically-typed class-based programming language with very few modifications to the existing runtime system. We describe the simple and efficient implementation strategy used in the Bigloo runtime system.

To help understand memory allocation behavior of Scheme programs, we have designed two complementary tools. The first one reports on frequency of allocation, heap configurations and on memory reclamation.  The second tracks down memory leaks. We have applied these tools to our Scheme compiler, the largest Scheme program we have been developing. This has allowed us to drastically reduce the amount of memory consumed during its bootstrap process, without requiring much development time.

Development tools will be neglected unless they are both conveniently accessible and easy to use. In order to avoid this pitfall, we have carefully designed the user interface of these two tools. Their integration into a real programming environment for Scheme is detailed in the paper.

Some contributions are currently available. They are nicely offered by their authors. Let them be thanked for this. These contributions are distributed with the hope that they will be of some help but, of course, no warranty is made about them. If you have written a Bigloo program that you think could be useful to other people, please, fill free to propose it as a contribution.

Bugloo is a command-line based debugger, but for the sake of simplicity you can use it with a GUI frontend too. So far, we have developped a GUI wrapper (shipped with the Bugloo distribution) that works with the GNU Emacs / XEmacs editors.

We introduce a new unification procedure for the type inference problem in the intersection type discipline. We show that unification exactly corresponds to reduction in an extended lambda-calculus, where one never erases arguments that would be discarded by ordinary beta-reduction. We show that our notion of unification allows us to compute a principal typing for any strongly normalizing lambda-expression.

In the first part, we define a new programming language with a functional core and generalised recursion, by using Boudol's type system with degrees to rule out unsafe recursions. The language is extended first with recursive records, then with mixins, allowing the programmer to fully mix functional and object-oriented paradigms. We also present an implementation, MlObj, and an abstract machine for execution.

In a second part, we design a new inference algorithm for intersection type systems, on an extension of the lambda-calculus. After proving its correctness, we study its generalisation to references and recursion, we compare it with existing inference algorithms, mainly System I, and we show that its finite rank version becomes decidable.

Current software and hardware systems, being parallel and reconfigurable, raise new safety and reliability problems, and the resolution of these problems requires new methods. Numerous proposals attempt at reducing the threat of bugs and preventing several kinds of attacks. In this paper, we develop an extension of the calculus of Mobile Ambients, named Controlled Ambients, that is suited for expressing such issues, specifically Denial of Service attacks.

Since it has no form of communication or substitution, we show how these notions can be simulated by mobility and modifications in the hierarchical structure of ambients. As a main result, we use these techniques to design an encoding of the synchronous pi-calculus into pure ambients, and we study its correctness, thus showing that pure ambients are as expressive as the pi-calculus. In order to simplify the proof and give an intuitive understanding of the encoding, we design an intermediate language: the pi-calculus with Explicit Substitutions and Channels, which is an extension of the pi-calculus in which communication and substitution are broken into simpler steps, and we show that is has the same expressive power as the pi-calculus.

The ambient calculus was designed to model mobile processes and study   their properties. A first type system was proposed by Cardelli-Gordon-Ghelli to prevent run-time faults. We extend it by introducing subtyping and present a type-checking algorithm which returns a minimal type relatively to this system. By the way, we also add two new constructs to the language. Finally, we remove the type annotations from the syntax and give a type-inference algorithm for the original type system.

The macro adds an extra parameters called &SKRIBE-EVAL-LOCATION that can be used inside the body of the defined function to retrieve the location of the call. This is extremely useful for function that defines new nodes. In general, it is desired that the location associated with these nodes is the user call to the function that has created the node, instead of the location of the call to the constructor.

Skribe is a programming language designed for implementing electronic documents. It is mainly designed for the writing of technical documents such as the documentation of computer programs. With Skribe these documents can be rendered using various tools and technologies. For instance, a Skribe document can be compiled to an HTML file that suits Web browser, it can be compiled to a TeX file in order to produce a high-quality printed document, and so on.

Skribe is highly skilled for computing texts. It is very common that one needs to automatically produce parts of the text. This can be very simple such as, for instance, the need to include inside a text, the date of the last update or the number of the last revision.

Sometimes it may be more complex. For instance, one may be willing to embed inside a text the result of a complex arithmetic computation. Or even, you may want to include some statistics about that text, such as, the number of words, paragraphs, sections, and so on.

Scheme.  Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr.: and Gerald Jay Sussman.  It was designed to have an exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.  A wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and message passing styles, find convenient expression in Scheme.The introduction offers a brief history of the language and of the report.The first three chapters present the fundamental ideas of the language and describe the notational conventions used for describing the language and for writing programs in the language.Chapters Expressions and Program structure describe the syntax and semantics of expressions, programs, and definitions.Chapter Standard procedures describes Scheme's built-in procedures, which include all of the language's data manipulation and input/output primitives.Chapter Formal syntax and semantics provides a formal syntax for Scheme written in extended BNF, along with a formal denotational semantics.

Warning: This is a stable-ish version of the project, but it totally lacks any sort of documentation whatsoever, and should only be used if you already know how to program in ULM (so that rules out 100% of the world, rounded down).

Contrary to standard sequential programming where the processor executes a single program, in concurrent programming the processor is a shared resource which is dispatched to several programs.  The term concurrent is appropriate because programs can be seen as concurrently competing to gain access to the processor, in order to execute.

Threads are a basic mean for concurrent programming, and are widely used in operating systems. They are also introduced in the Java language as first-class primitive. At language level, threads offer a way to structure programs by decomposing systems in several concurrent components; in this respect, threads are useful for modularity.

However, threads are generally considered as low-level primitives leading to over-complex programming.  Moreover, threads generally have loose semantics, in particular depending on the underlying executing platform; to give them a precise semantics is a difficult task, and this is a clearly identified problem to get portable code.

This paper proposes a new framework with clear and simple semantics, and with an efficient implementation. In it, threads are called fair; basically, a fair thread is a cooperative thread executed in a context in which all threads always have equal access to the processor. Fair threads have a deterministic semantics, relying on previous work belonging to the so-called reactive approach.

The structure of the paper is as follows: section Threads2 introduces threads and scheduling strategies; the FairThreads framework is defined in section Fair Thread Framework3; section Java FairThreads API4 contains the Java API for using FairThreads; three examples are given in section Examples5; finally, links with the reactive approach, which is at the basis of the fair thread proposal, are considered in section Links with Reactive Programming6.

When the processor is released by a thread, its execution context has to be saved in order to be able to resume the thread later. This is called a context switch. Context switches basically means to save the program counter and the execution stack associated with the executing thread, then to restore the context of a new thread (usually, some others items must also be saved/restored; for simplicity, we do not consider these).

As opposite to threads, processes have their own private memory space. This implies that communication between processes is more complex than communication between threads, which can directly use shared memory. This also implies that context switches are simpler for threads, since there is no need to save the address space which always remains the same. Because threads context switches need less computing resource than process context switches, threads are sometimes called lightweight processes. Note also that less memory swaps are needed using threads than using processes, as threads do not have their own private memory.

The way the scheduler chooses the thread to be executed is usually left unspecified; in this way, implementations are less constrained and, thus, can be more efficient. However, nondeterminism may occurs: with the same input, several distinct outputs are possible, depending on the scheduler choices. A major drawback of nondeterminism is that debugging becomes more complex (for example, faulty executions are more difficult to replay).

In the cooperative strategy, the scheduler has no way to force a thread to release the processor.  Thus, if the executing thread never releases the processor, then other threads never get a chance to execute. This situation can occur when, for example, the executing thread enters in an infinite loop. It is certainly a bug; however, in a cooperative context, this kind of bug is dramatic as it freezes the whole system.  In order to avoid such situations, threads must cooperate with other threads and always release the processor after some time.

In a preemptive strategy, the scheduler can force the executing thread to release the processor, when it decides to do so. Scheduler can use several criteria to withdraw the processor from the thread; one criteria is related to execution time: time slices are allocated to threads, and context switch occurs when the time slice given to an executing thread is expired. Other criteria exist, for example criteria related to priorities; for simplicity, one does not consider these.

There is no possibility, in the general case, to decide if a thread is cooperative or not (this is an undecidable problem). Thus, thread cooperativeness cannot be checked automatically and is of the programmer's responsability. This is a real problem for cooperative strategies, as presence of a non-cooperative thread can prevent the global system to work properly. On the contrary, presence of non-cooperative threads is not a problem for preemptive strategies, because they can be forced to release the processor.

In a cooperative framework, execution of a thread cannot be interrupted by the scheduler at arbitrary moments. This makes reasonning on programs easier: actually in a cooperative framework, thread execution is atomic as long as the thread does not release the processor. This contrast with preemptive context, where, by default, the scheduler can freely interleave threads instructions.

In a preemptive context, traditional sequential programs can be embbeded in threads and run without risk to prevent other threads to execute. Thus, preemptive schedulers are a good point for reusability. On the contrary, a "third-party" sequential program cannot be used just as it is in a cooperative framework, as it could prevent the whole system to progress.

Actually, both kinds of schedulers have freedom to chose the next thread to execute; however, a preemptive scheduler has additional freedom to preempt or not the currently executing thread; this additional freedom is a supplementary source of nondeterminism.

In preemptive frameworks, access to data in the shared address space must be protected because thread switches can occur in the middle of an access. Protection is usually based on use of boolean variables, called locks; a lock is set (taken) by the thread at the beginning of the data use and reset (released) by it at the end; while the lock is taken, other threads willing to access the protected data have to wait for the lock to be released. The test of a lock and its setting must be an atomic action, otherwise the scheduler could withdraw the processor to the thread just in between the test and the setting, leaving the data unprotected. Programmers are thus, in preemptive contexts, highly concerned with data protection. However, deadlocks can occur because of a bad locking strategy (a first thread locks a data needed by a second thread which similarly holds a lock on a data needed by the first). On the contrary, data are not to be protected in a cooperative framework, where threads run atomically. Note that atomicity of test and set actions is automatic; thus, simple boolean variables can be safely used for data protection.

Basically, threads unefficiency comes from context switches.  In a preemptive strategy context switches are not under control of the programmer, but of the scheduler; in some cases, the scheduler thus introduces context switches which are not necessary but cannot be avoided by programmers. In a cooperative context, it is the programmer's responsability to introduce cooperation actions in order to obtain threads cooperation. One thus generally considers that cooperative strategies can lead to more efficient executions than preemptive ones.

As modern operating systems are usually preemptive, this approach leads to preemptive threading systems.  This is the case of Microsoft NT system. Note that the mapping to kernel threads can be rather inefficient; for example, all thread manipulations in NT systematically introduce an overhead of 600 machine cycles [11].

In this approach, scheduler and user threads correspond to one process, mapped to one single kernel thread.  This approach is more flexible than the previous one, as the choice is left open for the scheduler to implement either a preemptive or a cooperative strategy, independently of the operating system characteristics.

There are also intermediate approaches, in which user threads are mapped to several kernel threads.  This is the solution proposed by the Solaris system of Sun[4]. In Solaris terminology, user threads are mapped to green thread which are grouped in light weight processes (LWP). LWPs are the units scheduled by the operating system.  This many-to-many approach is represented on Figure Many-many-mapping.

Linux.  Each Linux thread is a separate Unix process, sharing its address space with the other threads (using the system call clone()). Scheduling between threads is handled by the kernel scheduler, just like scheduling between Unix processes.

Very few languages introduce threads as first class primitives. The most well-known is of course Java[6].  Actually, however, Java basically introduces locks (with the synchronized keyword), and not directly threads which are available through an API.

Each thread can be preempted at any time, because scheduling can be preemptive. This implies that data have to be protected by synchronized code, as soon as they can be accessed by two distinct threads.  These protections are unnecessary when a cooperative strategy is used.

Each thread must periodically give up control in order to cooperate with other threads, because scheduling can be cooperative. Note that the basic yield() method for cooperation has a very loose semantics: it does not force a change of processor assignment, but only allows it to take place. Note also that sleep(long), which forces the executing thread to release processor, is not portable as it depends on the machine execution speed.

To sum-up, programmers have to code for the worst case for getting portable concurrent code (one does not consider priorities which do not at all solve the problem; see [11] for a discussion on this point).

Java programmers are faced with a second problem concerning threads: indeed, ways to get fine control over thread, that is ability to stop, suspend, or resume threads, have been suppressed from recent versions of the language[1].  Reason is that using these means is error prone (for example, stopping a thread can damage data that where locked by it).  This certainly weaken the language as, without fine control over threads, it becomes very difficult to program user specific scheduling strategies.

Fair schedulers give each thread an equal possibility to get the processor.  Thus, all threads get an equal right to execute. More precisely, fair schedulers define execution phases where all started threads run up to their next cooperation point, as shown on Figure Fair-scheduler.

More precisely, a fair scheduler broadcasts events to all threads started in it. Thus, all threads see events in exactly the same way, because they are broadcast. Moreover, events can have values associated to their generations, and these values are also broadcast.

The FairThreads framework is basically cooperative; it is thus simpler than preemptive ones.  Indeed, as preemption cannot occurs in an uncontroled way, cooperative frameworks are less undeterministic. Actually, FairThreads puts the situation to an extreme point, as it is fully deterministic; threads are chosen for execution following a strict round-robin algorithm. This can be a great help in programming and debugging.

Events are used when one wants one or more threads to wait for a condition, without need for them to poll a variable to determine when the condition is fulfilled. Broadcast is a mean to get modularity, as the thread which generates an event has nothing to know about potentially receivers of it. Fairness in event processing means that all threads waiting for an event receive it during the same phase where it is generated; thus, a thread leaving control to cooperate with other threads does not risk to loose an event generated later in the same phase. Note that scheduler phases actually define time scopes of events.

Fair threads are implemented in the Java programming language and usable through an API.  Fair thread implementation is based on standard Java threads, but it is independent of the actual JVM and OS, and is thus fully portable. Fair schedulers are actually at the level of the Java Virtual Machines; one thus have the situation shown on Figure Implementation.

As fair threads are basically cooperative, no lock is needed when accessing a shared object.  While executing, a fair thread cannot be interrupted by another fair thread; thus, execution is atomic and there is no need of synchronized code. This contributes to minimize deadlock situations which are the plague of concurrent programming.

Priorities are meaningless in a fair context, where threads always have equal rights to execute.  Absence of priorities also contributes to simplify programming. Note that the effect of priorities in Java is rather unclear (see [11] for a discussion on this matter).

A preemptive strategy is sometimes needed, for example to reuse a piece of code which was not designed to be run concurrently. In the context of fair threads, preemption is possible through the notion of a fair process, assuming that the operating system is preemptive. A fair process gives life to a standard process which is executed by the operating system concurently with the JVM running the fair scheduler. This gives the drawing of Figure Fair-process, where the fair process is represented as a black box.

Up to now, one has only considered uniprocessor machines.  When several processors are available, several threads can be simultaneously executed; this situation is often called parallelism. As threads are sharing the same address space, data protection becomes mandatory. Actually, this is very similar to preemptive scheduling; in both cases, shared data have to be protected against concurrent accesses, and it is the programmer's responsability to avoid deadlocks.

In operating systems, signals can occur at any moment during execution, and are to be processed without delay. Signals are useful to implement interrupts, for example asynchronous IO interrupts. In the context of fair threads, signals are quite naturally represented by events, which can be generated at any moment. Fair threads also offer the possibility for generated values to be immediately processed: generated values associated to events are broadcast to all components, and are received by them without delay, that is during their generation phase.

By calling method cooperate(long n) the fair thread falls asleep during n phases.  The method corresponds to the sleep(long) method of standard threads. Actually, cooperate(n) is a loop that runs cooperate() n times.

Value null is returned if no new generated value is available. In this last case, nextValue remains blocked up to the end of the current phase, and returns during the next phase (indeed, absence of a value is impossible to decide before the end of the current phase, as otherwise it could be produced by a thread scheduled later in the same phase). Method nextValue(String s) is similar, s being converted to an event.

Three examples are described. The first one is a very simple but complete example in which two fair threads are run.  In the second example, one defines a preemption mechanism to stop a fair thread when an event becomes present. The third example considers generated values and defines a way to process them.

Here is a small example of a complete program that runs two fair threads.  The first one cyclically prints hello, , and the second one prints world. The main method of the program first creates a fair scheduler, and then starts the two threads in it.

Output is an infinite list of hello, world messages. This is because the first thread, after printing the first part of the message, always leaves the processor and thus lets the second thread print the last part of it.

When considering the Until class of section Stopping Threads with Events5.2, one can see that there is no real need for using two distinct threads.  Indeed, it would be possible to merge the instructions of the controler with the ones of the controlled method; in this way, the Until thread would also test for the event presence, at fixed moments, say, just before execution of the cooperate method. Thus, unnecessary context switchings would be saved, which would leads to a more efficient execution. Such a solution is of course more difficult to program and less modular as  the code of the controlled method must be transformed.

The fair framework offers a way to conciliate efficiency and programming ease through the use of reactive programs. Reactive programs are basic elements of the Junior framework [9] which is a set of Java classes for reactive programming. Junior programs are usable through an API called Jr[10].

Reactive programming is based on the notion of an instant which is shared by all concurrent components.  Reactive programs are made of basic instructions, with semantics defined in term of instants. For example, the instruction Stop() of Junior stops execution for the current instant, and execution at the next instant restarts in sequence from it.  Event based programming is possible in Junior; events are instantaneously broadcast: an event generated during one instant is received by all components waiting for it during the same instant.

Junior instant corresponds to a fair scheduler phase, where all threads are executed once; events have exactly the same semantics in the two contexts; the cooperate() method of fair threads corresponds to the Stop() instruction of Junior.

Actually, instructions of concurrent programs in Junior are interleaved (by the Par operator) during each instant, in a way that allows broadcast of events. This approach is different from the one of threads, as there is no need of context switching in Junior; actually, context switches are replaced in reactive programming by interleavings, as shown on Figure Merge.

One has defined a new framework for concurrent programming in Java, based on the notion of a fair thread. Fair threads are run by fair schedulers which give threads equal rights to get the processor and equal rights to receive broadcast events.

The FairThreads framework makes a clear separation between the cooperative world and the preemptive one.  Fair threads are basically cooperative, and it is the programmer's responsability to program cooperation with other threads. However, there exists a way to embed non-cooperative code in FairThreads, through the notion of a fair process.

Two examples are presented: in the first one, a ball draws a circle as result of being moved by two distinct fair threads; the second example shows the use of broadcast events and of dynamic creation of objects.

Two fair threads are moving the same ball; one thread follows a sine path, and the other a cosine path. An applet is created which adds a third fair thread, for painting traces of the ball. At each phase, color of the ball changes, to visualize ball moves. One gets a circle; this is basically because the scheduler running the two threads is fair.

Balls are now dynamically created; they have two associated fair threads which are waiting for an event to start moving (following a sine or a cosine path). A button is used to create new balls at random positions; the sine button broadcasts the sine event to all fair threads; the cosine button broadcasts the cosine event; the sine+cosine button broadcasts both sine and cosine events.

The two reasons are:Bigloo produces C files. C code uses the C stack, so some programs can't be properly tail recursive. Nevertheless all simple tail recursions are compiled without stack consumption.

To allow and stimulate separate compilation, Bigloo compiles modules instead of entire programs. A module is composed of a module declaration and a module body, where a module body can be thought of as an incomplete Scheme program. Bigloo strictly enforces variable bindings. That is, it is illegal in a body to refer to unbound variables.In a module declaration, some variables can be declared to be immutable functions. For such variables, the compiler can then check if the number of arguments for some function calls are correct or not. When an arity mismatch is detected, Bigloo signals an error and aborts the compilation process.

The goal of the design of Bigloo is to allow the merging of high and low level programming. This means that Bigloo is designed to be fully connected to the already existing outside world of C.This connection has two components: a function call interface and a data storage interface. Bigloo code is able to call C code and vice versa; Bigloo data storage is accessible from C and vice versa. There are no frontiers between the Bigloo and C worlds.

Since release 1.9, Bigloo has included an object system. This system belongs to the Clos [Bobrow et al. 88] object system family but whose design has been mainly inspired by C. Queinnec's Meroon [Queinnec93]. It is based on ad-hoc polymorphism (generic functions and methods), uses single inheritance and mono-dispatch, and provides the user with introspection facilities.

Since release 2.4d, Bigloo has included a thread library. Bigloo supports Fair threads that are cooperative threads run by a fair scheduler which gives them equal access to the processor. Fair threads can communicate using broadcast events and their semantics does not depends on the executing platform. Fine control over fair threads execution is possible allowing the programming of specific user-defined scheduling strategies.

Type information, related to variable or function definitions, can be added to the source code. If no type information is provided, runtime checks will be introduced by the compiler to ensure normal execution, provided that the user has not used compilation flags to prevents this. If type information is added, the compiler statically type checks the program and refuses ones that prove to be incorrect.

A modules is a compiler and interpreter entity. Modules have been first designed for the compiler that compiles modules and then, links them against libraries in order to produce executables. A module may be split into several files but a file cannot contain more than one module. A module is made of a module clause that is a list for which the car is the symbol module and followed by any Bigloo expression (that is definitions or expressions). The module clause names the module and defines the scope of the definitions. At last, the module clause is also the place where foreign bindings are defined and where classes are defined. Recent versions of Bigloo (since 2.7b) fully supports modules from the interpreter.

A module is not related to a specific file and can be spread over several files if that is convenient. In particular, there is no relationship between module names and file names. The module declaration (see Module Declaration) must be the first expression in the first of the files containing the module; other expressions form the body of the module. The module body (see Core Language) contains global variables, function definitions and top level expressions (see Expressions).

This clause defines the entry point for a stand alone application to be procedure name of arity one. Bigloo invokes this procedure at the beginning of execution providing the list, composed of the shell command line arguments, as its single argument.

Then if this program is compiled into foo and invoked using the command foo -t bar, the list which is the argument for the main procedure start would be ("foo" "-t" "bar"). The special form args-parse helps main function argument parsing (see Command Line Parsing).

This is a list of file-names to be included in the source file. Include files are not modules and may have a special syntax. Thus, besides containing Bigloo expressions, they can contain import and include clauses, which must be written in a single list whose first element is the keyword directives. Includes files can be used to include implementation-neutral Scheme expressions and definitions in a Bigloo module. Here is an example of an include file.

The first alternative in iclause imports the variable named bind-name which is defined in the module module-name, located in the files file-name .... The second does the same but without specifying the name of the file where the module is located.

This clause specifies a list of modules which have to be initialized at runtime and is used to force the initialization of modules which are never imported but which are required by an application (see Embedded Bigloo applications).

A static clause has exactly the same syntax as an export clause. However, bindings declared static are local to the module. Since the default scope of all bindings is static, static module clauses are useful only for program documentation.

The first clause, (export-all), exports all the variables bound in the module (i.e., the variables defined in the module and the imported variables).  The second clause, (export-module), exports all the module's variables (those declared static and exported) to the interpreter; the third exports all the exports (i.e. the ones present inside an export clause) variables to the interpreter; the fourth and fifth clause each export one variable to the interpreter. The last clause imports a variable from the interpreter and all such imported variables are immutable (i.e. they cannot be the first argument of a set!  expression with the compiled code). Variables that are exported to the evaluators must be exported.  If a variable is exported to the evaluators but not exported within an export clause, the compiler will produce an error message.

The clause (class <bind-name>) exports a class definition to the interpreter. This makes the class constructor, the class predicate and the slots access functions available from the interpreter. The form (instantiate::class ...) and (with-access::class ...) are also available from the interpreter.

Apart from the initial word, this form has the same syntax as that used by define for procedures. Inline procedures are exportable which means that the compiler scans imported files to find the bodies of all inline procedures. Here is a small example of a module which exports an inline and a module which imports it.

Any procedure can be an inline. Also any exported procedure can be an inline provided all global variables and functions it uses are also exported.Note: Bigloo can decide to inline procedures declared with define but this can be achieved only with local procedures whereas procedures declared with the define-inline form are open-coded even through module importation.Note: Procedures declared inline are macro expanded with the macro defined in the module where they are invoked. That is, if module module1 declares an inline procedure p and module module2 imports it, p may have two different macro-expansions: one for module1 and one for module2.

Bigloo is different from languages such as C where a module is defined by a file. For Bigloo, the module name is not necessarily the name of the file where the text of the module is written and modules can even be split across several files.Since modules are defined independently of files, it is necessary to make a link between a module and its files and there are two ways of doing this.

Imported, included or loaded files are sought first in the current directory and then in the directories, sequentially from start to end, of the list in the *load-path* variable. This variable, initially set to the empty list, can be reset by the -I option of the compiler.

Semantics:  A match-case expression is evaluated as follows. key is evaluated and the result is compared with each successive pattern. If the pattern in some clause yields a match, then the expressions in that clause are evaluated from left to right in an environment where the pattern variables are bound to the corresponding subparts of the datum, and the result of the last expression in that clause is returned as the result of the match-case expression.

Remark:  and, or, not, check and kwote must be quoted in order to be treated as literals. This is the only justification for having the kwote pattern since, by convention, any atom which is not a keyword is quoted.

In a first section (Scheme Library) the Bigloo R5RS support is presented. This section also contains various function that are not standard (for instance, various functions used to manage a file system). Then, in the following sections (Serialization, Bit Manipulation, and System Programming Bigloo specific extensions are presented. Bigloo input and output facilities constitue a large superset of the standard Scheme definition. For this reason they are presented in a separate section (Input and Output).

Applies the function fun across the lists, returning the last non-false if the function returns non-false on every application. If non-false, the result of every is the last value returned by the last application of fun.

Applies the function fun across the lists, returning non-false if the function returns non-false for at least one application. If non-false, the result of any is the first non-false value returned by fun.

Bigloo has only three kinds of numbers: fixnum, long fixnum and flonum.  Operations on complexes and rationals are not implemented but for compatibility purposes, the functions complex? and rational? exist.  (In fact, complex? is the same as number? and rational?  is the same as real? in Bigloo.) The accepted prefixes are #b, #o, #d, #x, #e, #ex, #l, and #lx. For each generic arithmetic procedure, Bigloo provides two specialized procedures, one for fixnums and one for flonums. The names of these two specialized procedures is the name of the original one suffixed by fx or fl. A fixnum has the size of a C integer minus 2 bits.

The elong? procedures is a type checker for "hardware" integers, that is integers that have the very same size has the host platform permits (e.g., 32 bits or 64 bits integers). The llong? procedure is a type checker for "hardware" long long integers. Exact integers literal are introduced with the special #e and #ex prefixes. Exact long integers literal are introduced with the special #l and #lx prefixes.

For efficiency, string->real and string->integer do not test whether the string can be read as a number.  Therefore the result might be wrong if the string cannot be read as a number.These last procedures implement the natural translation from and to fixnum, flonum, elong, and llong.

Computes MD5 message digest.The function md5sum dispatches over its argument and invokes the ad-hoc function. That is, it invokes md5sum-string if its argument is a string, md5sum-mmap if it is a mmap, md5sum-port if its argument is an input port.

Return the length of the longest common prefix/suffix of the two strings. For prefixes, this is equivalent to the "mismatch index" for the strings (modulo the starti index offsets).The optional start/end indices restrict the comparison to the indicated substrings of s1 and s2.

This form provides an escape operator facility. bind-exit evaluates the body, which may refer to the variable escape which will denote an ``escape function'' of one argument: when called, this escape function will return from the bind-exit form with the given argument as the value of the bind-exit form. The escape can only be used while in the dynamic extent of the form. Bindings introduced by bind-exit are immutable.

This form provides protections. Expression expr is evaluated. If this evaluation requires the invocation of an escape procedure (a procedure bounded by the bind-exit special form), protect is evaluated before the control jump to the exit procedure. If expr does not raise any exit procedure, unwind-protect has the same behaviour as the begin special form except that the value of the form is always the value of expr.

Before and after are called, also without arguments, as required by the following rules (note that in the absence of calls to continuations captured using call/cc the three arguments are called once each, in order).  Before is called whenever execution enters the dynamic extent of the call to thunk and after is called whenever it exits that dynamic extent.  The dynamic extent of a procedure call is the period between when the call is initiated and when it returns.  In Scheme, because of call/cc, the dynamic extent of a call may not be a single, connected time period.

If a second call to dynamic-wind occurs within the dynamic extent of the call to thunk and then a continuation is invoked in such a way that the afters from these two invocations of dynamic-wind are both to be called, then the after associated with the second (inner) call to dynamic-wind is called first.If a second call to dynamic-wind occurs within the dynamic extent of the call to thunk and then a continuation is invoked in such a way that the befores from these two invocations of dynamic-wind are both to be called, then the before associated with the first (outer) call to dynamic-wind is called first.If invoking a continuation requires calling the before from one call to dynamic-wind and the after from another, then the after is called first.The effect of using a captured continuation to enter or exit the dynamic extent of a call to before or after is undefined.

Evaluates exp ... in a environment where var ... are bound from the evaluation of producer. The result of producer must be a call to values where the number of argument is the number of bound variables.

This function returns an output string port. This object has almost the same purpose as output-port. It can be used with all the printer functions which accept output-port. An output on a output string port memorizes all the characters written. An invocation of flush-output-port or close-output-port on an output string port returns a new string which contains all the characters accumulated in the port.

These functions set the file position indicator for port. The new position, measured in bytes, is specified by pos. It is an error to seek a port that cannot be changed (for instance, a string or a console port). The result of these functions is unspecified. An error is raised if the position cannot be changed.

The function read-chars returns a newly allocated strings made of size characters read from input-port (or from (current-input-port) if input-port is not provided). If less than size characters are available on the input port, the returned string is smaller than size. Its size is the number of available characters.The function read-char! fills the buffer buf with at most size characters.

Transfer the characters from input-port to output-port. This procedure is sometimes mapped to a system call (such as sendfile under Linux) and might thus be more efficient than copying the ports by hand. The optional argument offset specifies an offset from which characters of input-port are sent. The function send-chars returns the number of characters sent.

SRFI documentation.Accepts a message template (a Scheme String), and processes it, replacing any escape sequences in order with one or more characters, the characters themselves dependent on the semantics of the escape sequence encountered.An escape sequence is a two character sequence in the string where the first character is a tilde ~. Each escape code's meaning is as follows:~a The corresponding value is inserted into the string as if printed with display.

Scheme value to be present after the format string. The values provided as operands are used by the escape sequences in order. It is an error if fewer values are provided than escape sequences that require them.~% and ~~ require no corresponding value.

The mmap function asks to map a file into memory. This memory area can be randomly accessed as a string. In general using mmap improves performance in comparison with equivalent code using regular ports.

These functions get (resp. put) character and strings into a memory mapped area. They increment the read (resp. write) position. An error is signaled if the characters read (resp. writen) outbound the length of the memory mapped.

These operations are performed by the previous functions. The dump and the restore use the two functions obj->string and string->obj.It is also possible to use a binary file as a flat character file. This can be done by the means of output-char, input-char, output-string, and input-string functions.

The function input-string reads a string from a binary-port of maximum length len. It returns a newly allocated string whose length is possibly smaller than len. The function output-string writes a string into a binary-port.

Puts obj in table under the key key. This function returns the object bound in the table. If there was an object obj-old already in the table with the same key as obj, this function returns obj-old; otherwise it returns obj.

Returns a list whose elements are the result of applying fun to each of the keys and elements of table (no order is specified). In consequence, fun must be a procedure of two arguments. The first one is a key and the second one, an associated object.

Register proc as an exit functions. Proc is a procedure accepting of one argument. This argument is the numerical value which is the status of the exit call. The registered functions are called when the execution ends.

Canonicalizes a file name. If the file name is malformed this function raises an &io-malformed-url-error exception. In addition to handling .. directory name, the function file-name-unix-canonicalize also handles the ~ character.

Creates a new directory named string, including any necessary but nonexistent parent directories. It returns #t if the directory was created. It returns #f otherwise. Note that if this operation fails it may have succeeded in creating some of the necessary parent directories.

Change the access mode of the file named string. The option must be either a list of the following symbols read, write and execute or an integer. If the operation succeeds, chmod returns #t. It returns #f otherwise. The argument option can also be an integer that represents the native file permission.

Bigloo provides access to Unix-like processes as first class objects. The implementation and this documentation are to a great extent copies of the STk [Gallesio95] process support. Basically, a process contains four informations: the standard Unix process identification (aka PID) and the three standard files of the process.

Use the special keyword pipe: to redirect the standard input from a pipe. output: permits to redirect the standard output file of the process.  Redirection can go to a file or to a pipe. To redirect the standard output to a file, the name of this file must be specified after output:. Use the special keyword pipe: to redirect the standard output to a pipe. error: permits to redirect the standard error file of the process.  Redirection can go to a file or to a pipe. To redirect the standard error to a file, the name of this file must be specified after error:. Use the special keyword pipe: to redirect the standard error to a pipe. wait: must be followed by a boolean value. This value specifies if the process must be ran asynchronously or not. By default, the process is run asynchronously (i.e. wait: if #f). host: must be followed by a string. This string represents the name of the machine on which the command must be executed. This option uses the external command rsh. The shell variable PATH must be correctly set for accessing it without specifying its absolute path. fork: must be followed by a boolean value. This value specifies if the process must substitute the current execution. That is, if the value is #t a new process is spawned otherwise, the current execution is stopped and replaced by the execution of command. It defaults to #t. env: must be followed by a string of the form var=val. This will bound an environment variable in the spawned process. A run-process command may contain several env: arguments. The current variables of the current process are also passed to the new process.

Note: The call to flush-output-port is mandatory in order to get the dc process to get its input characters.Note: Thanks to Todd Dukes for the example and the suggestion of including it this documentation.

Returns a string which contains the name of the distant host attached to socket. If socket has been created with make-client-socket this procedure returns the official name of the distant machine used for connection. If socket has been created with make-server-socket, this function returns the official name of the client connected to the socket.

Returns a string which contains the IP number of the distant host attached to socket. If socket has been created with make-client-socket this procedure returns the IP number of the distant machine used for connection. If socket has been created with make-server-socket, this function returns the address of the client connected to the socket.  If no client has used yet the socket, this function returns #f.

The socket will be listening on the network interface name, either on the specified port, or on a port chosen by the system (usually the first port available on the network interface). The name can be an IP number as a string, or a host name, whose first IP address will be used (as returned by the name server lookup).

Close is a boolean; it indicates if the socket must be closed or not, when the connection is destroyed. Closing the socket forbids further connections on the same port with the socket-accept procedure. Omitting a value for close implies the closing of socket.

Returns the IP number of hostname. When hostname is not found, the io-unknown-host-error exception is raided (see Errors and Assertions).The function hostinfo possibly returns more information about the host. It returns an association list made out the information about the host. This list might contain a name entry, an addresses entry, and a aliases entry.Some back-ends (e.g., the C back-end) implements DNS caching. This may dramatically improve the performance of intensive networking applications.

Bigloo defines SSL sockets, on systems that support them, as first class objects. SSL Sockets permits processes to communicate even if they are on different machines securely via encrypted connections. Sockets are useful for creating secure client-server applications.

Bigloo supports two kinds of enumerated types: the structures and the records. They offer similar facilities. Structures where pre-exising to records and they are maintained mainly for backward compatiblity. Recors are compliant with the Scheme request for implementation 9.

Bigloo supports records has specified by SRFI-9. This section is a copy of the SRFI-9 specification by Richard Kelsey. This SRFI describes syntax for creating new data types, called record types.  A predicate, constructor, and field accessors and modifiers are defined for each record type.  Each new record type is distinct from all existing types, including other record types and Scheme's predefined types.

Define-record-type is generative: each use creates a new record type that is distinct from all existing types, including other record types and Scheme's predefined types. Record-type definitions may only occur at top-level (there are two possible semantics for `internal' record-type definitions, generative and nongenerative, and no consensus as to which is better).an instance of define-record-type is equivalent to the following definitions:<type-name> is bound to a representation of the record type itself. Operations on record types, such as defining print methods, reflection, etc. are left to other SRFIs.

Each <accessor-name> is a procedure that takes a record of type <type-name> and returns the current value of the corresponding field. It is an error to pass an accessor a value which is not a record of the appropriate type.

Each <modifier-name> is a procedure that takes a record of type <type-name> and a value which becomes the new value of the corresponding field; an unspecified value is returned. It is an error to pass a modifier a first argument which is not a record of the appropriate type.

Records are disjoint from the types listed in Section 4.2 of R5RS. Seting the value of any of these identifiers has no effect on the behavior of any of their original values.The following (define-record-type pare (kons x y) pare?

Bigloo's object system is designed to be as simple as possible and belongs to the Clos [Bobrow et al. 88] object system family in that it uses classes, generic functions and methods. Its design has been strongly influenced by C. Queinnec's Meroon [Queinnec93] It does not include any meta object protocol.

Wide classes (only for compiled modules) can only inherit from final classes. abstract classes can't be instantiated. Wide-classes cannot be defined within the interpreter.The optional constructor is an expression that must evaluate to a one argument function. This function is automatically invoked each time a new class instance is created. The constructor is passed the fresh instance. If a class has not defined a constructor the super class' constructors are searched. The first constructor found is invoked.

Virtual fields cannot be associated default values. Virtual fields may not be indexed fields. If a virtual field is not provided with a setter it must be annotated as read only.Info declarations allow arbitrary user information field values.

When an indexed field is referenced inside the binding part of a with-access form, the functions that accesses and changes the fields are bound inside the body of the with-access. In addition, a variable reporting the length of the field is also bound. For a field fd, the getter function is (fd-ref offset), the setter is (fd-set! offset value), the length variable is fd-len.

A generic function is a bag of specific functions known as methods. When invoked on a Bigloo object, a generic function determines the class of the discriminating variable (corresponding to the first argument of the generic function) and invokes the appropriate method. Generic functions implement single inheritance and each is defined using the define-generic Bigloo syntax.

Methods can be defined to specialize a generic function and such methods must have a compatible variable list. That is, the first argument of the method must be a sub-type (i.e. belong to a sub-class) of the first argument of the generic function. Other formal parameters must be of same types. Moreover, the result type of the method must be a sub-type of the result of the generic function.

Bigloo introduces a new kind of inheritance: widening. This allows an object to be temporarily widened (that is transformed into an object of another class, a wide-class) and then shrink-ed (that is reshaped to its original class). This mechanism is very useful for implementing short-term data storage. For instance, Bigloo compilation passes are implemented using the widening/shrinking mechanism. On entry to a pass, objects are widened with the specific pass fields and, on exit from a pass, objects are shrunk in order to forget the information related to this pass.Only instances of final classes can be widened and objects can only be widened in order to become instances of wide classes.

The object obj is widened to be instance of the wide class wide-class. Fields values are either picked up from the parameter list of the widen! form or from the default values in the declaration of the wide class.

Objects can be serialized and un-serialized using the regular string->obj and obj->string functions. Objects can be stored on disk and restored from disk by the use of the output-obj and input-obj functions.In addition to this standard serialization mechanism, custom object serializers and un-serializers can be specified by the means of the register-class-serialization! function (see Section Serialization.

Two objects can be compared with the equal? function. Two object are equal if and only if they belong to a same class, all their field values are equal and all their super class's field values are equal.

See section see Object library for information on classes and objects handling. Introspection facilities are, by default, available for all classes. However, in order to shrink the code size generation, it may be useful to disable class introspection. This decision can be taken on a per class basis (i.e., one class may be provided with introspection facilities while another one is not). The compiler option -fno-reflection (see Chapter Compiler Description) prevents the compiler to generate the code required for introspecting the classes defined in the compiled module.

Returns the a description of the fields of class. This description is a list of field descriptions where each field description can be accessed by the means of the following library functions. The fields are those directly defined in class. That is class-fields does not return fields defined in super classes of class.

A one argument function is returned. Applying this function to an object returns the length value of the field described by field. It is an error to apply class-field-len-accessor to a non-indexed field.

Returns a procedure of three, or two, arguments depending on whether the field is indexed or not. Applying this function to an object changes the value of the field described by field. It is an error to apply class-field-mutator to an immutable field.

Returns the creator for class. The creator is a function for which the arity depends on the number of slots the class provides (see Section see Creating and accessing objects).When an instance is allocated by the means of the class-creator, as for direct instantiation, the class constructor is automatically invoked.

Bigloo supports multithreaded programming. Two different libraries programming are available. The first one, the Fair Thread (see Section Fair Threads), enables, simple, easy to develop and to maintain code. The second one, the Posix Thread (see Section Posix Threads) enables more easily to take benefit of the actual parallelism that is now available on stock hardware. Because it is easier to program with fthread than with pthread, we strongly recommend to use the former as much as possible and leave the former for specially demanding applications. Both libraries are described in this chapter.

Returns the value of the parameter ident in the current thread. If no value is bound to this parameter, #f is returned.A thread parameter is implemented by a chunk of memory specific to each thread. All threads are created with an empty set of parameters.

Bigloo supports fair threads (see Section Thread), a specification of cooperative threads. In this framework a thread must explicitly or implicitly yield the processor to the scheduler (see Section Scheduler). Explicit cooperation is achieved by library functions such as thread-yield! or thread-sleep!. The scheduler does not preempt a running thread to allocate the processor to another waiting thread. Fair threads have two drawbacks over preemptive threads:Cooperative threads are not skilled to benefit of multi processors platforms.

On the other hand, Fair threads have advantages that make them suitable for a high level programming language such as Scheme:Fair threads have a strong and well defined semantic. Multi threaded programs using Fair threads are deterministic thus programs that deploy Fair threads are predictable.

Fair threads are easier to program with because they hide most the of the concurrent programming pitfalls. In particular, since Fair threads enforce a strong synchronization, there is no need to deploy techniques such as mutex, semaphore or condition variables.

Bigloo uses a set of primitive functions to create, run and handle thread. For the sake of standardization the name and semantic of SRFI-18 (Multithreading support) has been used. This section presents only the mandatory functions to program with Fair threads in Bigloo. The Section SRFI-18 presents the functions that are not necessary to Bigloo but supported for compliance with SRFI-18.

Associates a cleanup function to a thread. The cleanup function is called with the thread itself. The cleanup function is executed in a context where current-thread is the thread owning the cleanup function.

The current thread cooperates. That is, it is suspend for the reaction and the scheduler selects a new thread to be resumed. The scheduler resumes the next avaliable thread. If there is only one thread started in the scheduler, the same thread is resumed.

The current thread cooperates during exactly timeout reactions (see Scheduler). It is suspended and the scheduler selects a new thread to be resumed. If there is only one thread started in the scheduler, the same thread will be resumed.

The current thread waits until the thread terminates or until the timeout is reached (when supplied). If the timeout is reached, thread-join! returns timeout-val. If thread terminates, thread-join! returns the end-result of the thread or the end-exception if that thread terminates abnormally.If several threads wait for the termination of the same thread, they are all notified of the termination during the current reaction.

Blocks the thread until signal has been broadcast or until timeout is elapsed. The function thread-await! returns the value associated with the previous emissions of the signal that took place during the reaction.

Section Thread) in the scheduler until all the threads are blocked. A thread is blocked if the has explicitly yield the processor (thread-yield! and thread-sleep!) or because it is waiting a signal (thread-await!). A thread can be selected several times during the same reaction.

A procedure f of one argument. The procedure f is invoked after each reaction. It is passed a value i which is the iteration number of the scheduler. The reactions of the scheduler are stopped when f returns #f.

Broadcasts signal to all threads started in scheduler immediately, that is during the reaction. This function can only be called from within a running thread. If the optional argument val is omitted, the signal is broadcast with an unspecified value.

At the next react broadcasts signal to all threads started in scheduler. This is used to impact running threads from outside any threads. If the optional argument val is omitted, the signal is broadcast with an unspecified value.

This function takes one parameter which is the signal that is broadcast when the invocation returns. When the host operating system supports parallel executions, the invocation of proc is executed in parallel with the waiting thread. Asynchronous signals can be used to implement non blocking system operations, such as input/output. Here is an example that illustrates how to implement concurrent programs that behaves similarly with Fair Threads and Posix Threads.

The Bigloo modules initialization model does not permit to create threads before the main function is started. In other words, it is unsafe to use the Posix Threads API at the top level of modules. On some particular applications this might work correctly. On other it could produce an error message stating the threads cannot be created or started before the pthread library is initialized.

The current thread waits until the thread terminates. If thread terminates, thread-join! returns the end-result of the thread or the end-exception if that thread terminates abnormally.It is possible to wait for the termination of the a thread if and only if it has been started with thread-start-joinable!. In particular, threads started with thread-start cannot be joined.

Programming languages have poor reading libraries since the lexical information that can be specified is directly tied to the structure of the language. For example, in C it's hard to read a rational number because there is no type rational.  Programs have been written to circumvent this problem: Lex [Lesk75], for example, is one of them.

We choose to incorporate in Bigloo a set of new functions to assist in such parsing. The syntax for regular grammar (also known as regular analyser) of Bigloo 2.0 (the one described in this document) is not compatible with former Bigloo versions.

Defining a variable that already exists is acceptable and causes the former variable definition to be erased. Here is an example of a grammar that binds two variables, one called ident and one called number. These two variables are used within the grammar to match identifiers and numbers.

This is the Kleene operator, the language described by (* <re>) is the language containing, 0 or more occurrences of <re>. Thus, the language described by (* "abc") accepts the empty word and any word composed by a repetition of the abc (abc, abcabc, abcabcabc, ...).

The subexpression <re> has to be a sequence of characters. Sequences are build by the operator : or by string literals. The language described by (... int re), denotes, the first letter of re, or the two first letters of re, or the three first letters of re or the int first letters of re. Thus, (... 3 "begin") is equivalent to (or "b" "be" "beg").

Regular grammar generators, like Lex, are often coupled with tools, such as Yacc and Bison, that can generate parsers for more powerful languages, namely (a subset of) context-free languages. These tools take as input a description of the language to be recognized and generate a parser for that language, written in some other language (for example, Yacc and Bison generate parsers written in C). The user must always be aware of the generated parser and that is a nuisance.

The parser generator encounters a similar shift/reduce conflict this time, except that when it tries to determine whether to shift or reduce, it finds that both actions have the same precedence.  In this case, the parser generator looks at the associativity of the precedence group containing the op-add and op-sub.  Since these are declared to be left-associative, the parser generator chooses to reduce from this state, effectively calculating the 1 + 2.  Had these symbols been right-associative, the parser would have chosen to shift, effectively calculating 2 - 3 first.  If these symbols had been declared non-associative with the none: keyword, the parser would generate an error if it ever encountered this state.

This function takes three, possibly four, arguments. The first, lg, is the Lalr(1) grammar. The second, rg, is the lexical analyzer that feeds the grammar with tokens. The third argument, port, is the port that contains the input to be parsed. The last argument, emptyp, if provided, should be a function of one argument. It is called with each new token read from the port and should return #t if the token denotes the end of input. The result of the call is the value computed by the semantic actions of the production rules.

Lalr(1) grammar should follow some conventions:If a semantic value is to be associated with the token just parsed, the regular grammar should return a pair whose car is the token name (a symbol) and the cdr is the semantic value.

Another example of a metasequence is \t, which is a readable way to represent the tab character.We will call the string representation of a regexp the U-regexp, where U can be taken to mean Unix-style or universal, because this notation for regexps is universally familiar.  Our implementation uses an intermediate tree-like representation called the S-regexp, where S can stand for Scheme, symbolic, or s-expression.  S-regexps are more verbose and less readable than U-regexps, but they are much easier for Scheme's recursive procedures to navigate.

Here, pregexp-match-positions's return list contains only one index pair, and that pair represents the entire substring matched by the regexp.  When we discuss subpatterns later, we will see how a single match operation can yield a list of submatches.pregexp-match-positions takes optional third and fourth arguments that specify the indices of the text string within which the matching should take place.

The procedure pregexp-replace replaces the matched portion of the text string by another string.  The first argument is the regexp, the second the text string, and the third is the insert string (string to be inserted).

The procedure pregexp-split takes two arguments, a regexp pattern and a text string, and returns a list of substrings of the text string, where the pattern identifies the delimiter separating the substrings.

The procedure pregexp-quote takes an arbitrary string and returns a U-regexp (string) that precisely represents it. In particular, characters in the input string that could serve as regexp metacharacters are escaped with a backslash, so that they safely match only themselves.

Typically a character in the regexp matches the same character in the text string.  Sometimes it is necessary or convenient to use a regexp metasequence to refer to a single character.  Thus, metasequences \n, \r, \t, and \.  match the newline, return, tab and period characters respectively.The metacharacter period (.) matches any character other than newline.

Clustering, ie, enclosure within parens (...), identifies the enclosed subpattern as a single entity.  It causes the matcher to capture the submatch, or the portion of the string matching the subpattern, in addition to the overall match.

The number of submatches returned is always equal to the number of subpatterns specified in the regexp, even if a particular subpattern happens to match more than one substring or no substring at all.

Here the *-quantified subpattern matches threetimes, but it is the last submatch that is returned.It is also possible for a quantified subpattern to fail to match, even if the overall pattern matches.

Submatches can be used in the insert string argument of the procedures pregexp-replace and pregexp-replace*.  The insert string can use \n as a backreference to refer back to the nth submatch, ie, the substring that matched the nth subpattern.  \0 refers to the entire match, and it can also be specified as \&.

The modifier x causes the subpattern to match space-insensitively, ie, spaces and comments within the subpattern are ignored.  Comments are introduced as usual with a semicolon (;) and extend till the end of the line.  If you need to include a literal space or semicolon in a space-insensitized subpattern, escape it with a backslash.

You can specify a list of alternate subpatterns by separating them by |.   The | separates subpatterns in the nearest enclosing cluster (or in the entire pattern string if there are no enclosing parens).

An important thing to note about alternation is that the leftmost matching alternate is picked regardless of its length.  Thus, if one of the alternates is a prefix of a later alternate, the latter may not have a chance to match.

In any case, an overall match for the entire regexp is always preferred to an overall nonmatch.  In the following, the longer alternate still wins, because its preferred shorter prefix fails to yield an overall match.

The subregexp a* cannot be allowed to match all four a's in the text string "aaaa", even though * is a greedy quantifier.  It may match only the first three, leaving the last one for the second subregexp.

Nongreedy quantifiers match as few instances as possible, and progressively backtrack to more and more instances in order to attain an overall match.  There is backtracking in alternation too, as the more rightward alternates are tried when locally successful leftward ones fail to yield an overall match.

Here's an extended example from Friedl that covers many of the features described above.  The problem is to fashion a regexp that will match any and only IP addresses or dotted quads, ie, four numbers separated by three dots, with each number between 0 and 255.  We will use the commenting mechanism to build the final regexp with clarity.  First, a subregexp n0-255 that matches 0 through 255.

Scheme strings, not the regexp pattern itself.  When we want a literal backslash inside a Scheme string, we must escape it so that it shows up in the string at all. Scheme strings use backslash as the escape character, so we end up with two backslashes --- one Scheme-string backslash to escape the regexp backslash, which then escapes the dot.  Another character that would need escaping inside a Scheme string is ".

The function sqlite-exec executes an SQLite command. The command is the built by implicitly invoking sqlite-format on string and the optional arg arguments. This function returns a possibly list empty.

The function sqlite-eval invokes a SQLite command built by implicitly invoking sqlite-format on string and the optional arg arguments. The result of the function is built by applying procedure to the first value returned by the SQLite call.

Bigloo permits to signal an error via the error function. Errors are implemented by the means of exceptions (see with-exception-handler, with-handler, and raise forms). Assertions allow the checking of predicates at certain points in programs.

Compiler Description. That is, the list of the pending calls can be dumped by the runtime-system. The function get-trace-stack builds such a trace. The list built by get-trace-stack only contains the size top most pending calls. The function dump-trace-stack displays a representation of this stack on the output-port.

Returns the result(s) of calling thunk with no arguments. The handler, which must be a procedure, is installed as the current exception handler in the dynamic environment in effect during the call to thunk. When possible, prefer with-handler to with-exception-handler because the former is more efficient than the latter.

Calls the current exception handler with obj as the single argument. obj may be any Scheme object. Note that invoking the current handler does not escape from the current computation. It is up the to handler to perform the escape. It an error, signaled by the runtime system, if the current exception handler returns.

The argument exp is evaluated. If an error is raised, the handler is called. The argument handler is a procedure of four arguments. Its first argument is the continuation of try. The other arguments are proc, mes and obj. Invoking the first argument will resume after the error.

The variable level is the level of a trace. It is a positive integer. It enables simple filtering for traces. A trace is displayed if and only if the debugging level used to compile or to execute the program is greater than the trace level. The variable label is a label, .e.i., an identifier denoting the trace. This identifier will be displayed in debug mode.  The variable body is the body of the form, that is, the expression to be evaluated.Unless a trace is activated (with-trace lv la body) (when its level lv is greater than the current debug level) is equivalent to (begin body). When traces are activated, before executing body.The debugging level is controlled by two parameters: bigloo-debug and bigloo-compiler-debug (see Parameters).

This function returns a string which is the representation of args and that appears on the terminal in color color.Colors can be enable or disabled using the bigloo-trace-color parameter (see Parameters).

Bigloo includes an interpreter. Unfortunately, the language accepted by the interpreter is a proper subset of that accepted by the compiler. The main differences are:No foreign objects can be handled by interpreter.

Compiled code and interpreted code can be mixed together. That is, interpreted code is allowed to call compiled code and vice versa. This connection can be use to circumvent the missing features of the interpreter (see Section see Module Declaration, for a description of how to connect compiled and interpreted code).By default the evaluator assumes that operators from the standard library (e.g., +, car) are immutable. Hence, it optimizes these operators calls. This optimization can be disables using the bigloo-eval-strict-module parameter described in the chapter describing the parameters (see see Parameters).

The argument proc has to be a procedure of one argument and invoking this function sets the repl prompter. That is, to display its prompt, repl invokes proc giving it the nesting level of the current loop as its argument.

The load procedure reads expressions and definitions from the file, evaluating them sequentially. If the file loaded is a module (i.e. if it begins with a regular module clause), load behaves as module initialization. Otherwise, this function returns the result of the last evaluation. The function oadq differs from the function load in the sense that loadq does not print any intermediate evaluations.Both functions return the full path of the loaded file.

Loads a shared library named filename. Important note:  The function dynamic-load can only be used from interpreters linked against dynamic libraries. In particular, the dynamic-load function can be issued from the bigloo command if and only if the option --sharedcompiler=yes has been used when configuring Bigloo. If the bigloo command is not linked against dynamic libraries and if dynamic-load is required inside a read-eval-print loop (REPL) it exists a simple workaround.

As the example illustrates, when Bigloo modules are dynamically loaded, they are initialized. This initialization is ensure only if dynamic-load is called with exactly one parameter. If dynamic-load is called with two parameters, it is of the responsibility of the program to initialize the dynamically loaded module before using any Scheme reference.Note:  In order to let the loaded module accesses the variables defined by the loader application, special compilation flags must be used (e.g., -rdynamic under the Linux operating system). Dynamic-load is implemented on the top of the dlopen facility. For more information read the dlopen and ld manuals.

To be able to get access to foreign functions within the Bigloo interpreter, some extra measurements have to be taken. The foreign functions have to be present in the interpreter binary, which means you have to compile a custom interpreter. This is described in Section Using C bindings within the interpreter.

This form is itself macro-expanded into a define-expander form.Macro expanders cannot be exported or imported since there is no way to specify expanders in a module declaration.Macros defined with define-expander and define-macro are used by both the compiler and the interpreter.

Revised(5) Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.Implementation Note: Current Bigloo does not ensure hygiene for let-syntax and letrec-syntax. Hygienic expansion is only guaranteed for define-syntax.

The Bigloo parameters drive the global behavior programs. A parameter is accessed via a pair of functions: a reader and a setter. The type of the value is given, in this documentation, by the name of the parameter of the setter.

The bigloo-compiler-debug is automatically controlled by the compiler command line -g option (see Command Line Parsing). When a program is compiled in debug mode lvl, the compiler introduces a call to (bigloo-debug-set! lvl) before the evaluation of the first expression.The bigloo-debug parameter is used to control traces (see Tracing).

Bigloo supports command line argument parsing. That is, when an application is spawn from an Unix shell, the main function is called and its argument is bound to the list of the command line arguments, See Module declaration. The args-parse form may be used to parse these.

This is a procedure of one argument, an boolean. Args-parse-usage constructs an help message from all the option described in a args-parse form. Args-parse-usage is only defined in the <s-expression> of an args-parse form.

Section ref Module declaration, these annotations can be written both in the module clauses and in module bodies although module body type information is optional. It helps the compiler to produce better quality code and to reject incorrectly typed programs. Type annotations can describe both the result and formal parameter types for global functions and also types for local variable. Due to our module language design (in particular module initialization), Scheme global variables cannot support type information.Warning:  All type annotations are ignore by the interpreter.Module body type annotations are introduced by the following special forms.

We call all the pieces of program devoted to the interactions between Scheme and another language a foreign interface. In Bigloo, the foreign interface allows Scheme's functions and variables to be exported to a foreign language and foreign functions and variables to be imported into the Scheme code. Using the foreign interface requires two kind of operations.Declarations --- type declarations, import declarations or export declarations.

Foreign clauses are automatically ``transmitted'' by the importation process.  That is, if module module1 imports a module module2, module treats the extern clauses of module2 as though they were included in its own module declaration. Redefinition of a variable or a function already defined in an foreign clause is an error.

Extern clauses can be automatically generated using the Cigloo program which is distributed in the same package as Bigloo. Using Cigloo may be a good way to understand how C prototypes (and types) have to be declared in Bigloo. Cigloo reads C files and generates the Bigloo extern clauses for that files.

This rules applies unless s is a pointer or an array and then, to produce a C definition, the name of the elements of the array or the elements pointed by the pointer type are used. Hence, if v is for instance foo and s is (array int) the produced C code will be: int *foo.

The type obj denotes the super type of all Bigloo types (i.e., all Bigloo types, such as procedure, pair, ...) is an obj.  The type cobj denotes the super of all C types (i.e., all preexisting C types such as char, uchar, schar, short, ...). The type pair-nil denotes values that are either pairs or the () value.

Opaque types are relevant when a C value must transit via a Scheme function from a C function to another C function. The value can't be used in Scheme because no accessors are defined over that type it can only be send back to a C function.Here is an example of Scheme code using opaque type.

Note:  To illustrate the default type compilation of extern function, we have voluntary introduced an incomplete declaration for the fclose function. This will make Bigloo to produce a warning when compiling that module.

This force Bigloo to include string in the produced C code as a regular C fragment of code. This form must not be used without an in depth understanding of Bigloo C code production; with unskilled use, the produced C file may be unacceptable to the C compiler.Values can be passed to a pragma form, being referenced in string by expressions of the form $number.

Hence, pragma arguments can be of any types, including, foreign types.A pragma result type can be specified using the notation pragma::name where the default type is unspecified. Then, for instance, the expression (pragma::bool "$1 == 0" x) will be considered to be returning a object of type bool (C boolean) while the expression (pragma "$1 == 0" x) will be considered by Bigloo to be returning the unspecified typed object.The compiler assumes that a pragma forms operates a side effects and that it writes into its parameters. This assumption no long holds with free-pragma. This is the only difference between the two forms.

However, the -jvm option MUST be the first compiler option on the command line.In order to prevent the compiler to produce a script shell file to run the program, it is required to use simultaneously the -jvm and -c options.

The JVM back-end supports the entire Bigloo source language but the call/cc function. More precisely, using the JVM back-end, the continuation reified in a call/cc form can only be invoked in the dynamic extent of that form. The other restrictions of the C back-end apply to the JVM back-end. Mainly, Bigloo is not able to compile all the tail recursive call without stack consumption (however, most of the tail recursive calls are optimized by Bigloo and don't use stack activation frames).

Java clauses can be automatically generated using the Jigloo program which is distributed in the same package as Bigloo. Using Jigloo may be a good way to understand how Java classes, methods, and variables have to be declared in Bigloo. Jigloo reads Java class files and generate the Bigloo java clauses for that classes.

When the Scheme program completes normally, that is when the last expression of the Bigloo main is executed without error, the Bigloo runtime system explicitly call the Java function System.exit. In some situation, it may be useful to disable this call. For this, one must set the boolean Java static variable bigloo.foreign.must_exitp to false. This can be implemented in Java or in Scheme. Here is a Scheme module that sets the variable to false.

By default Bigloo modules are initialized when the application starts. It might be convenient to initialize the module when the Java classes implementing the Bigloo modules are loaded. It is possible to drive the Bigloo compiler to introduce code inside the Java class constructors for initializing the modules. This is the role of the -jvm-cinit-module compiler option.

We are currently improving and investigating about the performance of the JVM back-end. JVM performance is extremely sensitive to the host platform (for instance, very unfortunately, Linux seems to be a poor platform to run JVM code). Currently, it seems that the JVM back-end produces codes that are in between 4 times and 10 times slower than codes produced by the C back-end. The ratio between JVM and C is subject to changes. The gap between JVM and C code is bound to bridge because of the huge amount of efforts applied to efficiently implement Java virtual machines.

This function register a name for the library id. An optional version can be specified.Imagine that we would like to name our bformat library bigloobformat. This can be achieved by adding the following expression in the initialization file.

It is illegal for libraries to include inline functions that make use of new foreign types. By new foreign type, we mean foreign types that are defined inside the library. A library may contains inline functions but that inline functions must not even call function using foreign types in their prototypes. Including inline functions making use of foreign C type will make the compiler to fail when compiling user code. The compiler will fail prompting type errors. A library may contains non-inline functions that make use of new foreign types.

It is possible to implement a "read-eval-print-loop" that is extended with the facilities implemented inside a library. In order to make the variables, functions, and classes of a library visible from the interpreter, the eval library module clause has to be used.

Bigloo libraries require several steps before being completed. The first step is to build a library heap. This is achieved using a special compilation mode: -mkaddheap -mkaddlib -addheap -heap-library <ident>.

The options -mkaddheap and -mkaddlib tell Bigloo that it is compiling an heap associated file. The option -addheap tells Bigloo the name of the heap file to be produced. The option -heap-library instructs the compiler for the library name to be included inside the heap file. This name is used for checking versions at run-time.

A Bigloo library may be composed of several Bigloo modules (even if in our example only one module was used). The modules composing the library are free to import each other. Nevertheless, someone designing a Bigloo library should be aware that Bigloo importation creates dependences between modules. A module mod1 that imports a module mod2 depends on mod2 because mod1 requires mod2 to be initialized (i.e. mod1 calls to the initialization function of mod2). The result is that using import clauses inside modules composing a library may create a lot of dependencies between the object files that are used to build the associated Unix library. Dependencies should be avoided because they make the Unix linkers unable to produce small stand-alone programs. Instead of import clauses, use clauses should be preferred. Use clauses do not create dependencies because a module mod1 that uses a second module mod2 does not require mod2 to be initialized. Of course, it may happen situations where the initialization is mandatory and thus, the import must not be replaced with a use clause. The source code of the Bigloo library makes use of import and use clauses. The Bigloo standard library should be studied as an example.

Custom Types types are not documented yet. This facility enables extension to the standard Bigloo runtime system. The current implementation of custom types is subject to change. It will be documented in coming releases.

Bigloo supports various SRFIs (Scheme Request For Implementation). Some of them are integrated in the Bigloo core libraries. Some others are implemented by the means of Bigloo libraries (see Bigloo Libraries). Only the first ones are described in the manual.

Calling (register-eval-srfi! name) makes name supported by interpreted cond-expand forms. Note: There is no register-compiler-srfi! because the compiler automatically registers SRFI when the -library flags are used. However, it exists several ways to tell the compiler that it actually supports some srfis when compiling some modules.The first way is to insert calls to register-eval-srfi! in the .bigloorc file (see Compiler Description).

A Scheme script interpreter loads the <script>. It ignores the script prelude and interprets the rest of the file according to the language dialect specified by the name of the interpreter.The Scheme script interpreter may also load a different file after making a reasonable check that loading it is semantically equivalent to loading <script>. For example, the script interpreter may assume that a file with a related name (say, with an additional extension) is a compiled version of <script>.

When a procedure is applied to a list of actual arguments, the formal and actual arguments are processed from left to right as follows:Variables in required-formal-arguments are bound to successive actual arguments starting with the first actual argument. It shall be an error if there are fewer actual arguments than required-formal-arguments.

Next, variables in optional-formal-arguments are bound to any remaining actual arguments. If there are fewer remaining actual arguments than optional-formal-arguments, then variables are bound to the result of the evaluation of initializer, if one was specified, and otherwise to #f. The initializer is evaluated in an environment in which all previous optional formal arguments have been bound.

If #!key was specified in the formal-argument-list, there shall be an even number of remaining actual arguments. These are interpreted as a series of pairs, where the first member of each pair is a keyword specifying the argument name, and the second is the corresponding value. It shall be an error if the first member of a pair is not a keyword. It shall be an error if the argument name is not the same as a variable in a keyword-formal-argument, unless there is a rest-formal-argument. If the same argument name occurs more than once in the list of actual arguments, then the first value is used. If there is no actual argument for a particular keyword-formal-argument, then the variable is bound to the result of evaluating initializer if one was specified, and otherwise #f. The initializer is evaluated in an environment in which all previous formal key arguments have been bound.

There are four ways to change the behaviour of Bigloo. Flags on the command line, the option module clause runtime-command file and environment variables See Modules. When the compiler is invoked, it first gets the environment variables, then it scans the runtime-command file and, at end, it parses the command line.  If the same option is set many times, Bigloo uses the last one.

When the -fstack flag is enabled, the compiler may automatically replace some heap allocations with stack allocations. This may improve performance because stack allocations are handled more efficiently than heap allocations. On some cases, -fstack may also cause slow down or memory extra retentions. In this last case, when compile using -fstack the program will consume more memory. Unfortunately, this is nasty phenomenon is unpredictable (it depends on the nature of the source file).

By default, arithmetic procedures are generic. This means that it is allowed to use them with flonum and fixnum. This feature, of course, implies performances penalty. To improve performance, you may use specialized procedures (such as +fx, =fx, ... or +fl, =fl, ...) but, it is possible to suppress the genericity and to make all generic arithmetic procedures (= for example) fixnum ones. For this you must use the compiler option -farithmetic, or add the following module clause (option (set! *genericity* #f)) in your module declaration.

Each Bigloo's user can use a special configuration file. This file must be named ``.bigloorc'' or ``~/.bigloorc''. Bigloo tries to load one of these in this order. This file is a Scheme file. Bigloo exports variables which allow the user to change the behavior of the compiler.  All these variables can be checked using the -help2 option.The Bigloo's runtime command file is read before the arguments are parsed.

The extension package system allows the language compiled by Bigloo to be extended and this is achieved by associating an extension file with a suffix. The extension file is loaded at the beginning of a compilation and it can do three things: call extern programs (unix programs); define macros; modify the values of some of the compiler's variables (for example, the list of the libraries to be linked with). The Bigloo's initializing procedure is the following:If it exists, Bigloo loads the runtime-command file, see Section Compiler Description.

If the suffix is found, the associated file is loaded. This file could contain a function named *extend-entry* which must accept a list as argument. It is invoked with the Bigloo's unparsed arguments.

For now, two extension packages exist: the Meroon package which is a native version of the Christian Queinnec object language; the Camloo [SerranoWeis94] package which is a front end compiler for the Caml language [Caml-light]Furthermore, Bigloo supports the -extend option which forces the usage of an extension file. When Bigloo encounters this option, it immediately loads the extension file, invoking the function *extend-entry* with the list of arguments which have not been parsed yet.The extension files are always sought in the directory containing the Bigloo's libraries.

Bigloo allows the user to add a special pass to the regular compilation, this pass taking place before macro expansion. There are two ways to add a user pass.Add a compiled pass: The module user_user (in the ``comptime/User/user.scm'' file) is the user entry pass point.

Once, your .emacs is updated, to start the Bee you just need to edit a file suffixed with one of the suffix listed in auto-mode-alist with Emacs. You may either enter the Bee within Emacs with ESC-X: bee-mode.

The Bee Root Directory is the directory that contains information files that describe a project. When editing a file, the Bee tries to automatically setup the Bee Root Directory. For that, it seeks one of the following file: Makefile, .afile or .etags.

This search unwind directories until the root directory is reached or until the number of scanned directories is more than the value of the list variable bee-root-search-depth.An alternative Bee Root Directory may be set. This is done clicking on the Root of the tool bar icon.

This file must be the one that is the main entry point of your program or the one that implements an library heap file.When the Makefile already exists, using the same bindings update Makefile, re-generate .afile and .etags files.

Scheme source code may be interpreted within the Bee instead of been compiled prior to be executed. This facility could be convenient for fast prototyping. A Read eval print loop (henceforth Repl) could be spawned using the Repl icon of the tool bar, using the popup menu entry or using the C-c C-r C-r binding.Parts or the whole buffer may be sent to repl.C-c C-r b sends the whole buffer.

On-line documentation may be popped up. This is always done, clicking on the Info icon of the tool bar or C-c C-d i. If an emacs region is active, the documentation about that region will be popped up.

Searching for source (variable declaration, module definition, variable usage) is supported by the Bee. Clicking on the Find icon of the tool bar will pops up the definition of the variable the cursor is in or the definition of the module the cursor is in. These two operations may be requested using C-x 5 . for searching a variable definition, C-c C-d m for a module definition.Information and usages of a variable may be printed using either the Doc icon of the tool bar or the C-c C-d u key binding.

Bigloo bindings (functions and variables) may be automatically inserted in an export module clause (see Modules). Bring the cursor to an identifier of a binding that has to be exported then, either click on the Export tool bar icon or use the C-c C-m b key binding.Bigloo bindings may be automatically inserted in an import module clause.

C-c C-m i key binding. The Bee, will search the modules for the wanted binding. Foreign bindings (e.g. C variables and C functions) may be automatically inserted in the file module clause. Click on the Extern tool bar icon or use the key binding C-c C-m c to import whole the definition of an extern file. You will, be prompted an extern file name to be imported.

Once the debugger is not is possible to connect the current buffer to the debugger. This is done using the tool bar icon Connect or the key binding C-c C-b c. This enables breakpoints to be inserted using mouse clicks.

Automatically produced Makefile provides entry for profiling. In order to get a profile you must first compile your application for profiling.  This is done using a popup menu entry or the C-c C-p c key binding. Once your program compiled you can run for profile using a popup menu entry of the C-c C-p r key binding. This last will run your program, run bprof to get the profile and this will pops up a window displaying the profile informations.

The file that compose the project are listed in the pop entry of the Bee Root Directory Makefile.Checking out an older version of the file currently edited is done using the key binding C-c C-v C-o. This is not a retrieval of the entire project. Global check out may be performed manually. Comparing the version of the file currently edited with older one is done using C-c C-v d. A diff of the two buffers will be popped up.With both checking out and comparison of versions. A window presenting all the available version will be popped up to let you choose which version you would like to inspect.

When clicking on that anchor, the Bee will search the documentation file named by the path anchor and within that file, will search for a texinfo deffn command that defines the variable named in the anchor.

Esterel is both a programming language, dedicated to programming reactive systems, and a compiler which translates Esterel programs into finite-state machines. It is one of a family of synchronous languages, like SyncCharts, Lustre, Argos or Signal, which are particularly well-suited to programming reactive systems, including real-time systems and control automata.

The Esterel v5 compiler can be used to generate a software or hardware implementation of a reactive program. It can generate C-code to be embedded as a reactive kernel in a larger program that handles the interface and data manipulations. It can also generate hardware in the form of netlists of gates, which can then be embedded in a larger system. Extensive optimization is available. We provide a graphical symbolic debugger for Esterel. We also provide support for explicit or BDD-based verification tools that perform either bisimulation reduction or safety property checking.

This draft book presents the constructive semantics of Esterel and is the reference for the semantics. It also presents the translation of Esterel programs into circuits used in the Esterel v5 compiler. Current version : draft 3, July 2, 1999. Please discard former versions.

Reactive-C (RC) programs can react differently when activated for the first time, for the second time, and so on. Thus a new dimension appears for the programmer: the logical time induced by the sequence of activations. Each pair of activation/reaction is called an instant, and the reactive approach is thus an approach in which one reasons by reference to instants.

Actually, Reactive-C appeared rapidly as being a kind of reactive assembly language that could be used to implement higher level formalisms based on the notion of an instant. We now present several formalisms implemented using RC.

Nets of Reactive Processes The first formalism implemented in RC is called Nets of Reactive Processes (NRP). In this formalism, programs are made of reactive processes executed in parallel and communicating through unbounded fifo files called channels.

Reactive processes are sequential (that is, without parallelism) reactive programs which are able to put messages in their output channels, and to get messages from their input channels. The key point is that a process which tries to get a message from an empty channel does not remain stuck forever on that channel: reactive processes can test for channel emptyness.

The NRP model is actually an extension of the Kahn model, introduced in 1974, by allowing processes to test channels for emptyness, while preserving determinism. The test for channel emptyness gives NRP more expressive power than Kahn's networks. For example, it becomes possible to reset a process when it receives a message on a priority channel, which was impossible in Kahn's model.

The Reactive Object Model (ROM) is a new formalism that merges an object approach together with the notion of a global instant. In this model, methods can be invoked using instantaneous non-blocking send orders, which are immediately processed (that is, processed during the current instant).

Moreover, a method cannot execute more than once at each instant. This leads to an approach in which systems are decomposed into reactive areas where agents communicate inside their area by instantaneous orders, and between distinct areas, by usual unbounded delay orders.

A prototype language for the ROM model has been implemented in RC, as a set of macros and a library. Work on the ROM model is currently under way. We plan to design a true syntax for the present prototype language, and to study the embedding of the ROM model into a distributed framework.

A reactive script is a program represented as a character string and intended to be run by reactive interpretors. A reactive script interpretor is a broadcast event driven interpretor which can react to several commands in parallel.

The basic principle is that absence of an event cannot be decided before the end of the current interpretor reaction. Waiting for the occurrence of an event is the basic command. Commands can be composed in several ways to build complex behaviors. Moreover, one can also define objects with associated methods which are run when a nonblocking order is sent to them.

Icobj programming is a simple and fully graphical programming method, using a powerful means to combine behaviors. This programming is based on the notion of an icobj which has a behavioral aspect (``object'' part), a graphical aspect (``icon'' part), with an ``animation'' aspect.

REJO is an extension of Java that creates Reactive Objects, that's to say, objects that have data and a mix of java instructions and reactive instructions. The execution model is that of Reactive Synchronous Approach which executes the java instructions in an atomic way. These objects may be considered as Mobile Agents because they can migrate using a platform, called ROS, that provides the functionalities that they need.

This tutorial presents the basis for building a reactive system using REJO language. The first section introduce reactive systems and agents systems. The section 2 presents REJO: program's structure and instructions. Section 3 describes the steps for compiling and running a REJO program. Finally, section 4 gives some examples and section 5 resumes the characteristcs of REJO.

A language that integrates, in a transparent way, the reactive code and the imperatif code. There were some tries like the Reactive Scripts [10] but in this one the integration is restraint and only the interpret case is considered.

This paper presents REJO language which is the proposition of a new reactive language, it is rather an extension of Java in order to create REactive Java Objects (REJO). The reactive objects can migrate in a natural way using the reactive framework, and the necessary functions typical of Mobile Agent (like the assignation of names) are provided by the platform named ROS. This platform executes the objects and provides the typical operations of a MAS. From now on we'll use reactive object, REJO and agent as synonyms.

REJO is high level language that allows programmers to build reactive systems easily. As a high level language, REJO translate its instructions in a low-level language (Junior) hiding its complexity. In the case of REJO, it hides the complexity of using logic conditions (called Configurations in Junior), using atomic instructions, and using reactive variables (called i.e. IntegerWrappers). It also introduces some notions that don't exist in the low-level language, for instance the notion of method, local reactive variables, and the inheritance of reactive behaviors.

OO code vs Imperative code. The OO model used is that of Java, i.e. Java defines the relation between data and code, and the code is programmed in an imperative style. In particular Java defines 3 concepts1) the relation between imperative code and data; they are encapsulated and see like one unit, a class, 2)the creation of objects from a class definition, the instantiation of a class, 3) the contructions of one class from another one, i.e. the inheritance and its rules.

Imperative code vs Reactive code. Imperative code coexist with reactive code thanks to the definition of a reactive instruction, the atom instruction. This coexistence is unidirectional, i.e. imperative code is not executed if the reactive code does not execute it (executing an atom instruction).

OO code vs Reactive code. The relation between the reactive code and the OO model follows almost the same rules that the relation between imperative code and the OO model. In other words reactive code behaves as imperative code in the OO model: 1) reactive code is encapsulated with data (a REJO class), 2) the instantiation of a REJO class creates a Reactive Object and, 3) REJO class may be built inheriting from another REJO class. The particularites in the relation between reactive code and the OOmodel are due to the execution reactive model, for exemple variables are evaluated according to the notion of intant defined in the reactive model.

The REJO language was built with the objective of obtaining a high level language based on the Junior language. In other words the REJO language was born from the evolution of the Junior language and that is why REJO keeps many concepts from Junior (those that we think are the main advantages of Junior) and hides and adds others (those that make the reactive programming difficult or miss in Junior). One of the main advantages of Junior, that REJO keeps, is the specification of its execution model using rewriting rules. Rewriting rules are used to define the semantics of each reactive instruction as well as the notion of executing a Junior program (look Reactive Synchronous Model description).

As you can see in the figure 1, the Junior semantics does not define the relation among reactive instructions and variables. Of course that no language can be used without the concept of variables and that is why Junior defines Wrappers.

Wrappers allows programers to define variables that will be evaluated , at run time, by reactive instructions. The problem with Wrappers is that they are difficult to use because it is a low level concept that does not allow programers to implemented scopes of variables. In addition the notion of method, that may have parameters and local variables, does not exist and so there is no way to make a program in a modula way.

Reactive method: A reactive method is the asotiation of an identifier, the method name, and a set of reactive instructions. The set of reactive instructions must define a well-formed reactive program according to the Junior semantics defined in (). A reactive method returns always a Junior program and so its not necesary to have a keyword like return.

Invocation of a reactive method: The invocation of a reactive method makes a copy of the reactive instructions of the method and puts the copy where the invocation was done. The invocation of a reactive method can be done statically or dinamically. If the invocation is done statically Local variable: A local variable is the asotiation of a name and a zone of storage. The scope where the local variable can be used by its name is that of the reactive method that declarates it. Local variables can be used outside of its scope if they are objects and a references to the object is stored in a global variable. In conclusion a local variable is defined in the same way of Java.

If the type of the local variable is a basic type (int, float, double, etc) its value is a copy of the formal parameter value. If the type of the local variable is an objetc, the local variable contains a reference to the formal parameter object, in others words it is the same object. In conclusion the parameters are implemented in the same way of Java: basic types are passed by values and objects by reference.

Like Junior, the graphical representation of a REJO program is a tree formed by nodes that represent reactive instruction. The reactive methods are represented by a set of nodes (enclose in a dotted box ) that form a conex graph. Each reactive methode may have a space of variables asociated.

In order to execute a Junior program one use a reactive machine that makes react the reactive instructions. Like Junior, REJO uses also a reactive machine to make react reactive methods, this means that it is possible to execute many reactive methods of differents REJO objects and to execute Junior programs at the same time.

The structure of a REJO class is the same as a Java class to which it can be added special methods named reactive methods. These reactive methods have their own syntax which is very similar to the Java syntax and is given in the next section, and their own semantic, the Junior semantic. A REJO program may have several reactive methods and they can be put anywher inside of the class.

To load the REJO class in a ROS either by loading manually one instance of the class or using the loader provided by the ROS system, the reactive shell (Rsh). Rsh will create an instance of the class and it will automatically add it in the system.

The sequence of reactive instructions is a reactive instruction which is hidden to the programmer. Besides of sequence of reactive instructions there is another compound instruction, the par instruction which is explained in the section 2.6.

Java instructions are executed like atomic instructions. An atomic instruction is an instruction that finishes instantaneously, i.e. it starts and finishes its execution in the same instant. The notion of instantaneously termination is a concept to keep in mind because some reactive instructions may take one or more instants for being executed, i.e. they can finish instantaneously or not. There is another instruction, like the atomic one, that also finishes instantaneously: the nothing instruction. The nothing instruction is used for implementing the execution model and programmers rarely will used it.

The instructions of the reactive methods are executed in sequence without interruption until the stop instruction stops the execution for the actual instant. The end of an instant is defined in the same way as Junior, when all the instructions finish or are stopped. In general, programmers do not care about instruction's state, TERM, STOP or SUSP, because these values are handled by the reactive machine for implementing the behavior of each instruction. However, in order to understand how the program is executed they have to take them in account.

This section finishes with the presentation of one of the simplest programs that can be programmed in REJO, the program that prints ''Hello World''. This program uses the instruction System.out.print that prints a string on the screen atomically.

The problem with this restriction is that it forces you to write a Java method each time that you want to use any flow control structure and to make an atomic invocation to it (remember that invocations are valid expressions).

We end this section with two atomic instruction used for printing: print and println. These instructions are similar to the System.out.println Java instruction. These instructions are provided for defining the standard output in ROS platform. In order to use them out of ROS platform you have to implement the Agent and Output interfaces (for more information about them look at ROS documentation).

The distinction between Java methods and reactive methods is done because the last ones are reactive instructions that are built and and introduced at the point where the call keyword was used, i.e. the call instruction is basically a macro. The consequence of this is that it is not possible to use recursion in reactive methods.

The par instruction implements a primitive parallelism. It is a primitive parallelism because its branches are not executed at the same time as in a multiprocessors system and the parallelism is controlled by the programmer using the stop instruction. This parallelism can be seen as a variant of threads programming in which you give explicitly the control. In REJO you do it using the stop instruction and in threads programming you usually use a method called yield.

The par instruction implements a primitive parallelism in which the branches are activated at each instant and the par instruction finishes when all the components have finished. The semantics of par instructions does not specify the order in which the branches are executed and thus you should not assume an specific order 2 when you build your program.

A loop is an instruction that allows to execute several times a set of instructions named loop's body or body. If the number of times is infinite, we say that it is an infinite loop, otherwise it is a finite loop. In REJO, like in Junior, two instructions allow creating infinite loops and finite loops; they are named loop and repeat respectively. In this section we present the loop instructions and the next section presents the repeat instruction.

As it was said, the loop instruction implements an infinite loop, however when you use this kind of loop you have to pay attention in the way of using this instruction. If you build a loop that, after having completely executed its body during an instant, restarts immediately to execute it in the same instant, we say that you have an instantaneous loop. Instantaneous loop are potentially dangerous because they can stop the execution of whole program, remember that you are programming a cooperative system and that this means that soon or late you must give the control to the other components if you want that the system evolves.

Like Java, the parenthesis "{" and "}" are necessary if the body has more than one reactive instruction; this is also true for the other REJO instructions described in the following sections. Of course we recommend, like in any programming language, to indent your programs in order to make them understandable.

The next example shows the construction of an instantaneous loop. In fact this program will block the machine because it never gives the control to the others components (you should never make a program like this, you should use loop with at least one stop).

This instruction implements finite loops, in other words it executes its body a fixed number of times: the value read the first time that the instruction is executed. Unlike infinite loops, the fact that the body finishes instantaneously is not a problem because it will finish so it is not dangerous to omit the stop instructions.

In REJO, as in Junior, you can use variables in reactive instructions. A problem with these variables is that they have to be read when the reactive instruction is executed and not when the instruction is built. In order to resolve this problem, Junior defines Wrappers of Variables, for example IntegerWrappers and BooleanWrappers. One of advantages of using REJO is that Wrappers are used when they are necessary, i.e., the compiler builds them whenever a variable is used in a reactive instruction. The only precaution that you have to take in account, as usual, it is that types match.

For example, when you use a repeat instruction you can use a variable for defining the number of times that the loop will be performed. The repeat instruction specifies that this number is read the first time we execute the instruction, thus if you put a variable, like in the following example, the repeat instruction will be executed with the value read when the instruction is executed the first time (3 times for the given example below) and this value does not change if you change the variable's value.

This instruction allows picking and following the execution between two branches according to the evaluation of a boolean condition. If the condition is true then the first branch (if branch) is executed, else the second one (else branch) is executed. Boolean conditions are java boolean conditions with one restriction: they cannot test the presence or the absence of events, for doing that you have to use the when instruction (section 2.14).

In REJO you can also use Event Conditions, i.e. you can build expressions for testing if two or more events are present in the same instant (AND operator) or testing if at least one of them is present (OR operator). You can also test if an event is not present in the instant (NOT operator). These are the only 3 operators that you can use for testing conditions formed with events.

An Identifier allows defining events using any kind of object that has at least an equals method. Thanks to this abstraction programmers can use any basic data type or a combination of them, for instance, integers as events. However, the use of Identifiers implies that programmers must define their own notion of event. For avoiding this job, REJO defines the StringIdentifier type that allows generating Strings as events. Of course String events are handled transparently by REJO and thus you do not have to define anything. For more information about Identifiers look the Junior spec.

Note that the syntax used in the example 1 accepts neither objects nor expressions whereas the gen syntax accepts string expressions (like in example 3), Objects and Identifiers. In the examples 5 and 6 the variable and the method can be strings or Identifiers, the gen instructions test the type.

When an event is generated, no matter its type, you can attach an object to it, in other words you can generate events with values. In this way, it is possible to not only synchronize behaviors using events but also communicate data at the same time.

This instruction implements a reactive behavior which consists in waiting that a event conditions is true. If the event condition is true the control pass to the next instruction in the same branch, otherwise the instruction waits untill the event condition is true. The wait is implemented by testing if the event condition is false or the end of instant is achieved. If the end of instant is achieved the instruction returns stop, i.e., it behaves as a stop instruction for that instant.

The particularity of this instruction is that it can finish instantaneously and when it does not finishes instantaneously its behavior hides a stop instruction. The instruction finishes instantaneously when the event condition is satisfied before the end of instant and the chosen branch (the first branch if the condition is satisfied and the else branch in the other case) finishes in the same instant. We say that it hides a stop instruction because if the value of event condition in known at the end of instant, for example when the absence of an event is tested, then the chosen branch is executed at the next instant.

The following example shows the effect of the stop instruction hidden in the when instruction. The program is compound by two branches: the first one generates the event "E" in the fourth instant and the second one tests its presence. The fact is that even though the second branch tests the presence of the event it does not detect it because the branch is unsynchronized with the first one because of the introduced stop instruction.

This instruction implements the preemption, in other words it forces the termination of a set of reactive instructions (the body of the until instruction) according to an event condition. The preemption is weak, i.e., it occurs after body reacts, if the event condition becomes true and the body has stopped. Junior, and therefore REJO, uses weak preemption for avoiding causality problems.

The until preemption can be instantaneous or not. We say that it occurs an instantaneous preemption if the event condition is true during the instant; in this case the handler is executed instantaneously, i.e. in the same instant.

We end this section suggesting that you take a look at REJO's structure. REJO structure is a good example that shows the use of event conditions with local, control, until and par instructions for building a set of instructions that allow users to resume, suspend and kill a reactive program using events. This is the control mechanism used in the ROS platform.

This instruction allows freezing a program that is been executed in the machine; in other words, the program is removed from the machine and is stored in a machine's internal variable. The program is frozen when an event, given as a parameter, is generated. Actually the program is frozen when the instant finishes for avoiding causality problems. If at the next instant somebody freeze an instruction using the same event, the old frozen instruction will be lost, therefore you have one instant for taking them from the machine.

When you build a REJO, you have the possibility of choosing if the REJO will be an agent or not. If the REJO is an agent it can be executed in the ROS platform and uses the ROS services, for exemple the migration between ROS systems, the ROS name service and the REJO control service. In order to build an agent you have to program it and compile it in a particular way; these particularities are explained in this section and the following. For avoiding confusion we will only call agent a REJO that can be executed in the ROS system.

API) that can be invoked using the ros variable available in all agents. The ros variable (and other agent variables explained also in the ROS API section) is updated automatically by the ROS system when the agent is loaded. The next subsection shows an example of ros variable.

Some ROS services are launched by the generation of events, for instance the migration service is started by the generation of an event. In fact, the migration service is started by the generation of two valued events which have as identifier the name of the Agent plus the string "!migra" and as data the machine address and a ROS identifier.

The following example illustrates the migration service. It defines a REJO that does nothing for 100 instants and then try to migrate, at the end it uses the migGet primitive defined in the Agent interface for verifying if the migration was successful.

The ROS identifier is used when there is more than two ROS systems in the same machine. By default ROS systems uses Ros1 identifier but you can change it (see ros options). Machine address has the typical Internet adreess, e.g. polka.inria.fr.

These methods are used for freezing and reinitializing resources, for example termin method can be used for freezing resources when the agent finishes its execution and warmUp can be used for setting up variables when the agent restart in a remote site.

The steps to compile and execute a REJO program are similar to those of a Java program. First you compile the REJO class using the REJO compiler and then you run the programm using a reactive machine. The second step is simpler when using the ROS system because it creates the Java main method, a reactive machine and loads agents.

Since the used development tools are based on Java language, the class path passage (and some Java properties) was simplified by the cration of some shell script. The REJO compiler, named REJOC, is a script shell that executes the REJO parser with a REJO file name as parameter. The script makes two compiling phases, one to verify the syntax and translate the reactive instructions to Junior reactive instructions, and another to compile the produced Java code.

This example shows how you can build a REJO that uses graphics objects, for example objects that uses AWT or Swing. This REJO implements a counter that prints its value in a window which is destroyed when the body is preempted using the event fin.

This program shows how you can resolve the typical problem of accessing a shared resource. The propose is not to resolve completely the problem of philosophers but to shows how you can use Java methods, Reactive Methods and other reactive instructions. Of course the other point that we want to show with this examples is how simple is to resolve shared access when you use cooperative systems, you don't have to use semaphores or another synchronization mechanism because you are sure that nobody preempt you.

This example implements 3 philosophers using one REJO. The behavior of each philosopher is modeled by a reactive method called Phil. The Phil method executes a infinite loop executing in sequence 3 reactive methods that model the behaviors: Thinking, Hungry and Eating.

This program show how you can use inheritance in REJO and how you can continue using low-level Junior primitives for building reactive behaviors. This REJO extends the previous one and redefines the Waiting and Eating methods. The redefinitions of Waiting method is done using Junior instructions; the new behavior is the same of previous one (this is done for showing how REJO works and to glance at Junior Programming) but instead of waiting five instants the wait is random. The redefinition of Eating method use the old definition of Waiting method and puts in sequence two times the original behavior, in other words the Eating method defines 10 instants for eating.

It is an alternative to the use of Java cooperative threads. Java programmers can also use FairThreads [8], a Java package that implements cooperative threads, programmed with Java style, with Junior.

Cooperative system presents some advantages over a preemptive system, and in the case of Java the reactive model provides other advantages over the threads programming [7]. The three main drawbacks of java threads programming are: 1) the lack of a semantic in the execution model of threads, 2) a reduced number of threads by user, and 3) the lost of time doing unnecessary context switches.

The mobile agents executed by ROS are the Reactive Objects produced with the REJO language. REJO agents may migrate through several ROS sites which offer the services that they need. ROS is a prototype that lacks of some importants services, for example security service and group service, but it is a research project used for testing new ideas.

This page presents the ROS system. The ROS's characteristics are given in the section 1, its architecture as well as some details of its implementation are given in the section 2. The section 3 explains the migration stages and the section 4 explain the two interfaces that has ROS: the user interface(Reactive shell) and the programmers interface. Finally, the section 5 finishes comparing ROS with other platforms, and the section 6 does a resume of the system and describes the set of possible improvements.

ROS is the evolution of RAMA platform that was created by Navid Nikaein [16] with the objective of test the reactive approach in the construction of mobile agents. The result was a system that showed that the reactive approach is suitable to the construction of MAS. MAS are complex systems that may be studied according to the properties and services offrered [20].

When an agent migrates from one site to another it may migrate 3 things: data, code and state of the program. In general it is easier to migrate without the state of the program because it depends of the platform (according to the processor it must be saved the registers, the stack and the program counter). When an agent migrates without the state of the program the migration is called weak mobility and in the other hand strong mobility.

In adition, the execution state of Junior programs can be saved without problem because its implementation does not depend on the processor (thanks to Java and to the Junior execution model). In conclusion REJO agents use strong mobility; the migration process is described in section 5.

Hence, an agent have to know the address of its destination node. In order to resolve this problem many approaches have been proposed, the most known are to get the addresses from another agent or to define in the agent a list of sites for visiting. The two algorithms present the problem to become useless because either the service searched is not longer available or the topology have changed.

ROS system does not offer any particular routing algorithm, however agents may implement without problem the routing algorithm of list of sites for visiting which is easy to implement and use. Another possible routing algorithm to implement is the RAMA's routing mechanism, the virtual bi-directional ring.: agents migrate on a virtual network, built by the MASs, which facilitates the migration by building a ring topology and offrering a very simple primitive to migrate to the next noed in the ring. Routing is a delicate field because routhing algrithms must be choosen carefully, e.g. ring routing is a high level migration algorithm that only produce good performaces when the ring is "not to big".

One of the strategy used for program a system using agents paradigm is the algorithm divide and conker, i.e. the problem is divided to resolved easily. In this type of applications the communication mechanism offrered by the MAS is crucial and that is why MASs offre local, global and group communications.

ROS takes advantages of the instantaneous broadcast that offers the reactive approach to implement local communication. Global communication may be done migrating between the different sites or using the ROS service of remote event generation (in this case de communication in not synchronous). The means of communication of the reactive paradigm, the broadcast, is a transparent synchronous communication that allows agents to receive the same information at each instant.

Like the mechanism of localization of a MAS, the mechanism of naming is a very important part of a MAS because it allows to resolve many problems. The mechanism of localization is used to communicate agents that are physically in different machines. Once resolved this problem, it exists the problem of identifying if two or more equal agents are in the same machine such as the different clones used to resolve a problem. The only way to resolve this problem is to have a naming mechanism which assign unique names, for instance, a global naming mechanism or a naming mechanism in function of the machine name, user name and a count. Of course each mechanism has its advantages and disadvantages that may be read [20].

ROS naming mechanism provides locally unique identifiers for agents using a combination of the agent's creation name and a number assigned locally and arbitrary. The assignation of global identifiers requires a global name service which is a good option for local networks but not always for WAN networks.

In order to create easily an agents, it is necessary a programming language adapted to the agent requirements, for exemple it must have some properties such as portability, robustness, and security. In adition the programming language has to make easily the programming of high level behaviors, and the programming of the interaction among agents (possibly in the same group). Java language provides without problem some of the requirements (it is a quite portable language) but there are others that are not offered at all and the programmer must implemente (high level behavior programming is difficult).

ROS system is a research project with the goal of applying the RSM in the construction of a MAS. It is not intended to build a big system with the typical MAS services, instead we want to offer the tools to build one taking advantage of RSM properties: dynamic execution, broadcast events and semantics. Since the MAS architecture is similar to that of an Operating System, ROS was built as one. In particular it was built with the philosophie of micro-kernel; the micro-kernel implements the basic functions that agents require and offers the means to add new modules so as to increase its functionalities.

In order to facilitate the utilization of the system, three interfaces were built: the API_Kernel interface that describes the way of using the system (adding o removing REJOs), the MigrationSrv interface that offers the migration service and the Agent that defines a minimal set of methods which must have the REJOs to be executed.

This architecture can be improved either using other modules or adding agents to the system, like in RAMA, to do administration tasks, for instance, an agent may travel the topology to control its members or to create a members list of a group.

If the ROS system is executed using the steps of a Junior program one have to 1) create a Junior reactive machine, 2) create a Junior program, 3) load the Junior program in the reactive machine and 4) activate the reactive machine.

Rsh in mode text. If one of the basic kernel modules (the kernel or the machine demon) can not be started, the system stops and returns an error code to the user. The only ROS service that does not stops the start up process is the migration module; in that case the kernel prints an error messages and launch the Rsh.

Finally, ROS may be started inside of other programs (Embedded Systems) without problem because its code is small and it does not impose any graphic interface; the option -k may be used in these cases.

The Reactive Shell (Rsh) was created with two goals: 1) make easier the execution of REJO programs and 2) have an interpreted language to take advantages of these kind of languages, i.e. to debug reactive programs and to execute quickly littly reactive programs (scripts) to test ideas. Rsh is similar in some aspects to Reactive Scripts [10] but in general they are differents: the set of reactive instructions is smaller in Rsh and mainly the execution model is different,.

ROS offers a few primitives to administrate agents; in particular ROS allows programmers to create, destroy and migrate agents. To create an agent you create a REJO agent. To destroy an agent (its reactive behavior) or migrate it one uses the communication mechanism offered by the RSM, events. To destroy an agent one uses the convention of generating an event composed by the local name plus the suffix !kill. To migrate an agent one use the convention of generating a valued event putting in the data field the target address. In fact the migration is started by the generation of two valued events which have as identifier the name of the Agent plus the string "!migra" and as data the machine address and a ROS identifier.

All this steps depende on the platform, for exemple to implement strong migration it is necessary to stop the agent and to get the value of CPU registers; to send a copy of an agent it is important to know which format is used and usually this depends on the network protocol used.

Stoping the agent execution: REJO agents stop its execution at the end of an instant in a natual way. Therefore the only problem that exists is to be able to remove the code from the machine to avoid its execution at the next instants.

REJO agent structure contains a frezzable instruction to remove the reactive code from the reactive machine. The event used to remove the code is a string formed by the name of the agent plus the string "!migra".

Loading the agent in the machine: If the remote migration daemon accepts the execution of the agent, the daemon charges it in the remote ROS using the ROS API, in particular the int load(Agent); method is used. Otherwise the agent is reloaded in the local machine. To reload an agent in the local machine REJO uses the Run reactive instruction.

Another important aspect in the migration mechanism is the way of it is implemented in the RSM. The reactive instructions that implement the migration may be programmed in two ways: 1) they are added in the machine at run time (in a particular instant) or, 2) they are coded in the agent. In both cases the migration is started by the generation of an event because of freezable instruction. In the first case the migration takes two instants and it is less depended on the agent structure. In the second case the migration takes one instant and it is more depended on the agent structure.

When the ROS system loads a REJO, it must know which method will be executed in the first place. The rmain method is the only agent method executed by ROS and thus it must generate the reactive instructions (Junior instructions) to be executed. The locName method returns the agent local name.

The others methods are used by specialized programs which manipulate the execution of agents i.e. the reactive shell and the migration service. Most specialized methods and variables contained in an agent are stored in the AgentData class.

This method load a REJO in the system. The unique condition to load it is that it has the rmain method. This method is used to load the REJOs that arrive from the reactive shell or from another machine (migration). There are two more methods to load an agent specifying the standar output device and/or passing some environment string variables.

This method allows to add reactive instructions without the REJO structure, for example, in order to implement a programmable shell as the Reactive Scripts, or simply in order to add instructions that allow to tests the REJOs.

Dynamicity: There are three types of dinamicity: 1) agents may be charged and removed from the ROS system, 2) agent behavior may be modified and 3) the topology f the network formed among ROS systems may be modified at run time.

Adding the property of persistence to the agents. This property allows to restart the execution of an agent in some points of its execution, in presence of fails. Thanks of freezing mechanism of reactive instructions, this property may be added naturally.

This property is easy to implement: one just change the Engine Daemon module which does evolve the machine and to implement the two phase commit protocol. The concept of distributed reactive machines that share the same instants is not new but this allow to continue it in the framework of mobile agents in order to make the synchronous migration.

Creating automatically the automate equivalent to the reactive part of a REJO program. This automate would allow to check and to validate properties of agents before to be loaded, i.e. to make a kind of QoS (Quality of Service).

The REJO language handles: a) All the reactive instructions that are in the Junior interface. b) Events using Strings or Identifiers, and using logic expressions. c) All the other elements that make of REJO a language that defines a Reactive Object Model, for instance reactive methods, local variables in reactive methods, etc.

However, in its graphical version it has some problems in the way of putting the cursor. In general it doesn't detect some syntax errors and for the moment scripts aren't REJOs so you can not kill them.

The semantics of SugarCubes code is deterministic and does not depend on arbitrary choices made by the execution platform. SugarCubes gives programmers a sound and fine control over execution; for example, reactive instructions can be preempted in a totally clean way. The paper compares the use of threads and the one of SugarCubes. It shows that SugarCubes is simpler and more structured than the standard Java threading mechanism.

Reactive machines schedule reactive instructions in a deterministic way. Execution is totally independent from the platform; it does not depend on a particular scheduling strategy (cooperative or preemptive models).

Full portability. To write a truly platform-independent threading system is an extremely difficult task[Ho]. Reactive machines and reactive instructions they run map into one unique Java thread executed by the Virtual Machine. This simplifies portability task in a great extend.

Clear semantics. Reactive instructions have a simple formal semantics, the existence of which opens the way to several optimization and validation techniques (based on the notion of a finite states machine).

Reactive instructions communicate using built-in broadcast events which provides the programmer with a safe, high-level, and powerful communication mechanism. This is to be compared to Java threads with which the programmer must implement communication protocols only using the low-level wait/notify synchronization primitives.

SugarCubes does not presently support parallelism which maps threads on distinct processors. All reactive instructions run by a given reactive machine are run by the same Java thread, thus, by the same processor.

The current version of the SugarCubes code is not optimized. There is work to do, to get better execution performances (for example, by embedding reactive instructions directly in the Java Virtual Machine).

Executions of reactive instructions are divided into time fragments called instants. How long instants last depends on the statements actually executed. There is a potential problem with a too heavily fragmented reactive instruction, as it could slow down the other concurrent reactive instructions.

Pure Java. SugarCubes is standard pure Java. Thus, reactive instructions can be used everywhere in Java code. Moreover, threads are not used at all in SugarCubes, which thus can be used without any risk to raise some thread-related problem.

To compare threads and reactive instructions, we choose the small example of two concurrent activities sharing the same object and needing some synchronization. More precisely, one activity consists in animating a graphical icon following a sinusoidal path (sine), and the other consists in animating the same icon following a sinusoidal path with a shift of p/2 (cosine). The icon is of course the shared object. Naively, the intended behavior of the icon is to draw a circle, as natural combination of sine and cosine moves. Synchronization of the two activities is the mean to get this behavior.

Of course, the example could appear as a rather academic exercise as one can simply get the circular behavior without using any concurrency at all. But a sequential solution would clearly be less modular and less flexible than a concurrent one. Anyway, the goal of this text is to compare two solutions to deal with concurrency, not to compare concurrency and sequentiality.

The text has the following structure: SugarCubes is briefly described in section 2. The example and its coding using threads are given in section 3. Section 4 contains the SugarCubes coding of the example. Finally, in section 5, one briefly considers the SugarCubes possibilities of fine control over reactive instructions and the use of broadcast events.

The aim of the reactive approach is to propose a flexible programming of reactive systems, especially those which are dynamic (that is, the number of components and their connections are changing during execution). Information on this approach can be found on the Web3.

The two main notions of SugarCubes are reactive instruction whose semantics refer to instants, and reactive machine whose purpose is to execute reactive instructions in an environment made of instantaneously broadcast events.

SUSP (for suspended) means that execution of the instruction has not reached a stable state and must be resumed during current instant. This is for example the case for the instruction that waits for a not yet generated event (see below): execution is suspended to let the other components the possibility to generate the event during the current instant.

A call to method terminate forces the instruction to completely terminate and thus to return TERM when activated. A call to method reset resets the instruction which thus returns in its initial state.

Atoms to execute basic Java statements such as printing messages; atoms are immediately-terminating reactive instructions. More precisely, upon activation, an atom executes its method action and immediately terminates by returning TERM.

Until to preempt execution of a reactive instruction by an event; execution of the instruction (called the body) is abandoned when the event is generated. Note however that preemption is a weak one: the body is still executed at the very instant of preemption, but will not be executed at following instants.

The class Machine implements reactive machines. A reactive machine executes a program which is a reactive instruction. It performs two main tasks: first, it decides the ends of instants, and second, it deals with broadcast events. Initially, the program is the Nothing instruction which does nothing and terminates instantaneously. New instructions are dynamically added to the program (by calling the method add) and executed in parallel with the previous ones, using the Merge parallel instruction.

At the end of each program activation, the machine tests if some new events were generated during this execution. If it was not the case, then there is no hope that future program activations will change the situation, and the end of the current instant can be safely decided.

Reactive machines are reactive instructions (class Machine extends Instruction). To execute one instant of the program of a machine, one call the method activ of the machine, with the machine as parameter of the call.

How does the applet behave on screen? Naively, one expects that the icon would draw a circle, as a natural combination of sine and cosine moves. Unfortunately, this is not the case: with a cooperative platform, the first executed thread of SinMove or CosMove would never give up the control and the icon would not move at all on screen (the graphical thread would be starved); with a preemptive platform, one would get arbitrary moves, depending on the way threads are scheduled.

Moreover, one gets a circle with cooperative platform, as sine and cosine are executed in turn. Thus, one obtains a very simple solution for cooperative platforms. Unfortunately, it does not work with preemptive ones, as yield() calls do not prevent the platform from scheduling tasks in an arbitrary way.

Please note that, as a side effect of synchronization, the shared object icobj becomes protected: sine and cosine are actually atomic actions. This can be an important matter when several threads can change the same icobj coordinate. Let us suppose for example that a second instance of SinMove is added. Then, if accesses where not atomic, the two instances calling sine could interleave their statements with an unforeseeable result.

Now, the icon smoothly draws a circle. However, one must adjust the sleeping time to the machine execution speed (in the present case, 15 milliseconds, for a Sun ultra sparc 1 station). The solution is, thus, not portable.

Another way to compensate the lack of synchronization with the graphical thread, is to force an applet update after each move, using the applet method update (which returns upon graphics update completion).

In the previous solution, the graphical update actions are performed after each move. Unnecessary updates exist because, as SineMove and CosMove are executed in turn, only one update over two is really needed.

Results are highly dependent of graphics orders being processed or not. Globally, when graphics orders are processed, SugarCubes is faster on Sun platforms (both 1 and 10) and very close to the generic thread-based solution on Linux. When graphics orders are not processed (programs are not executed as applets and method update does nothing), SugarCubes are, on Sun, slower with one icobj, but faster with two or three; on Linux, SugarCubes is always slower than thread-based solutions. Measures on Macintosh differ completely with the two versions of the MRJ used (2.0 and 2.1 alpha).

All these results are rather difficult to interpret and we feel that more work has to be done on that subject, including other examples. Moreover, the new version of the SugarCubes which is in preparation should be faster than the current version 1, and comparison should be continued when available.

SugarCubes gives the programmer a complete control over the execution of a reactive instruction. For example, reactive instructions can be forced to terminate using the Until preemption operator. This operator is actually the counterpart4 of Thread.stop which is a source of problems and is deprecated in the new version 1.2 of Java (see [JSD] for details).

Please note that reactive statement preemption is structured: the Until instruction can only preempt its body (the first loop). This is certainly a good point compared to the lack of structure of Thread.stop() with which one can preempt any thread as soon as a reference on it is available.

SugarCubes provides the programmer with a powerful communication based on broadcast events. To show the power of broadcast, let us consider a system made of two icobjs and suppose than one wants to simultaneously reverse their trajectory. The solution with broadcast events is extremely simple and natural: basically, there is nothing to do! the two reactive instructions that pilot icobjs share the same event change which is broadcast; thus, the two trajectories change at the very same instant, when change is generated.

Event broadcast is modular. Suppose that new activities can be dynamically introduced into the system. Then, there is no need to change anything when a new instruction becomes active, as it automatically gets the same vision of events than the others instructions have (provided, however, that introductions of new instructions take place at the very beginning of instants). Modularity also allows the programmer to introduce "observers" (instructions that do no generate any event) in a system with the guaranty that it will have no effect at all on the others components.

The first problem is that a thread-based system must run on BOTH preemptive and cooperative platforms. Adding yield() calls is necessary for cooperative context, but does not solve the problem with preemptive ones: with preemptive platforms, yielding actions issued from the system and from the program are inextricably mixed; it is like if somebody behind the scene was dropping yielding actions in a totally uncontrolled (and may be unfriendly) way. To change this situation and regain control over preemptive platforms, programmers have to implement complex strategies.

The second problem appears when threads need to communicate; for this purpose, threading systems only offer low-level primitives based on the notion of a lock. Thread programmers often try to overcome the problem by limiting communications and synchronizations as far as possible. Actually, they try to limit at the maximum the use of concurrency which leads to monolithic, rigid, and non-modular programming.

The semantics of SugarCubes code does not depend on arbitrary choices made by the reactive machine executing it. Semantics is completely captured by the code. This is a deep difference with threads, the semantics of which depends on the underlying execution platform.

Coding with SugarCubes is actually very close to coding assuming a cooperative platform. Scheduling is basically performed "by hand" (using Stop, the counterpart of yield) and the programmer has to control how concurrent activities are fragmented. This leads to deterministic executions with a clear semantics. Cooperative strategies lower the needs of synchronizations to implement atomic accesses to data.

Using the preemption operator of SugarCubes, termination of reactive instructions can be forced in a completely safe way; the preempted instruction is allowed to finish the current instant and is thus in a stable state when preemption takes place.

SugarCubes offers a powerful and modular communication mechanism based on instantaneously broadcast events. This frees the programmer from always re-implementing high-level communication mechanisms each time threads must communicate.

SugarCubes is a simple and structured approach to concurrency which can be seen as an alternative to Java threads, especially when dynamic combinations of communicating concurrent components are needed.

SugarCubes basically introduce the notion of a global logical clock, and system runs are decomposed into instants shared by all parallel components. This is the reactive paradigm of which the description can be found at http://www.inria.fr/meije/rc.

The two main SugarCubes classes are Instruction and Machine. Instruction defines reactive instructions which are defined with reference to instants, and Machine defines reactive machines which run reactive instructions.

SUSP (for ``suspended'') means that execution of the instruction has not reached a stable state for the current instant, and has to resume during that instant. This is for example the case when awaiting for an event not yet generated (see section 5): execution suspends to give other components the opportunity to generate it.

A reactive machine of the Machine class runs a program which is an instruction. Initially programs are the Nothing instruction (defined in section 3.1) which does nothing and terminates instantaneously.

In this section we introduce the basic instruction to stop and suspend execution for the current instant, the sequence and parallel instructions, atoms to execute basic actions, loops, and the closing statement.

The Merge class extends BinaryInstruction and implements basic parallelism: at each instant the two instructions left and then right are activated in this order. It terminates when both left and right do terminate.

Note that termination of the Merge only occurs at the second instant because of the Stop instruction in the first branch. Note also that printing of end occurs in the second instant. Sequencing is ``instantaneous'', that is control goes to the second component of the sequence as soon as the first one terminates.

A loop is said to be ``instantaneous'' when its body terminates completely in the same instant it is started. Instantaneous loops are to be rejected because such a loop would never converge to a stablestate closing the instant. The Loop class detects instantaneous loops at run time, when the end of the loop body is reached twice during the same instant. In this case, the loop stops its execution for the current instant instead of looping for ever during the instant.

Finite loops of the Repeat class execute their body a fixed number of times. Unlike infinite loops, an instantaneously terminating body is not a problem, as it does not prevent the loop to terminate. Therefore, there is no detection of instantaneously terminating bodies of Repeat instructions.Repeat contains two integer field: num which is the initial number of cycles, and counter which is the number of cycles performed so far.

To indicate that an event is generated during the current instant, one sets its generated field to this instant number. In that way all events are automatically reset at the beginning of each new instant.

The value (present or absent) of an event can only be known safely after the event is fixed, that is as soon as it is generated, or otherwise at the end of the current instant. Event presence values aredefined in the EventConsts interface.

Event configurations of the class Config are boolean expressions of events: a configuration can be the and, or the or of two events. It can also be the negation not of an event, which is true when the event is absent. A configuration is ``fixed'' when its value can be evaluated safely. For example, a configuration which is a simple event (of the class PosConfig defined bellow) is fixed as present as soon as the event is present, or else it is fixed as absent at the end of the current instant.

In this section we introduce instructions related to events: generation of an event, control of an instruction by the presence of an event, waiting for an event configuration, preemption of an instruction, and presence test of an event.

The Generate class extends Atom which means that event generation terminates instantaneously. Generating an event in a machine calls the machine newMove method to indicate that something new happens in the system; thus, instructions waiting for the event (see next 5.3) will have the possibility to see it as present during the current instant.

Await extends Instruction and contains a Config field. The activation method returns SUSP while the configuration is not fixed, then it evaluates it. If evaluation returns false, meaning that the configuration waited for is not satisfied, then the method stops. If evaluation returns true, meaning that the configuration waited for is satisfied, then the Await terminates and returns TERM if the end of the current instant is not already reached, STOP otherwise. For example evaluation of the configuration corresponding to ``not e'' returns true if e was not generated, and activation returns STOP in this case. This is coherentwith the basic principle of 4.1 which states that the absence of an event cannot be decided before the end of the current instant.

Until extends BinaryInstruction and implements preemption: execution of the left instruction, called the ``body'', is aborted when an event configuration becomes true. One says then that left is ``preempted'' by the configuration and, in this case, control goes to right which is called the ``handler''.

When extends BinaryInstruction and gives the control to the left or right instruction according to an event configuration. Evaluation of the configuration only takes place at the instant thecontrol reaches the When instruction and the choice of the branch to be executed is final.

In this example, one first adds an instruction which waits for an event named e and then prints ``e!'' to a machine . The machine is run and a copy of the previous instruction is also added to it. Then, the machine is run for the second time. Finally, an instruction which generates e is added, and the machine is run for the third time.

Note that the two Await instructions are both fired during the same third instant where the event is generated (events are broadcast). Note also the use of the clone method to get a copy of the instruction.

We have presented an overview of SugarCubes to program reactive instructions (Instruction class) run in parallel by reactive machines (Machine class) and communicating with broadcast events (Event class).

There is no possibility to know that a channel is empty at a given instant, before the end of this instant; thus reaction to emptyness is always postponed to the next instant. This is the exact counterpart for channels of the basic principle of SugarCubes for events.

In this paper we define channels, the notion of a reactive process, and the notion of a reactive machine for reactive nets. We give the definition of some basic processes and use them to code two small examples.

The abstract class ReactiveProcess of reactive processes extends Instruction. It defines a fix method which returns TERM is its channel parameter is not empty, STOP it it is empty (which is known only at the end of the current instant), and SUSP otherwise.

Funnel does not remain for ever stuck on an empty input channel; emptyness of an input channel (when fix returns STOP) cannot be decided before the end of the current instant, so switching to the opposite input channel can only take place at next instant.

Commands are grouped in blocks : they are executed in sequence when separated by ``;'' and in parallel when separated by ``||'' ; a parallel block terminates when all its branches do (parentheses are used for precedence purposes).

If G does not occurs before both E and F does, then all works as if the until command was not there: E! is printed as soon as E occurs, F! is printed as soon as F occurs, and Terminated! is printed simultaneously with the last event, as then the body of the until terminates. On the contrary, if G occurs while E or F have not yet occurred, then the until command is exited at the next reaction and Terminated! is printed at that time.

New statements can be dynamically added to a behavior, to be executed in parallel with it. The syntax to add a statement i to a behavior b is ``add i to b''. Like for behavior redeclarations, the effect of adding a statement to a behavior is postponed to the next instant.

Traditionally, objects encapsulate data which are processed by their methods. In reactive scripts we put the focus on behavioral aspects, and the task of defining and using variables and data is transferred to Java.

Because of the control statement, a method M of O is given one reaction each time the statement send M to O is executed, and is not executed otherwise. Moreover, execution is immediate: once a method is called during a reaction, it runs during this reaction.

The send command terminates immediately (as the generate statement), and does not wait for the called method to start to execute. It is a ``send and forget'' order in which the caller can immediately continue to execute (thus, this is an asynchronous call). Note that non-determinism can occur, as to send two orders in sequence during the same reaction does not prevent thesecond one to be processed before the first (see [1] for an example).

Methods are ``one shot'': only the first call to a method is actual, the others having no effect (because generating the same event several times is equivalent to generating it once). The ``one shot'' property is important to prevent objects to enter into interblocking situations where, for example, two objects call each other for ever.

Objects are removed from the interpretor by destroying them, using the destroy command. The removal of an object does not prevent it to execute for the current reaction: the removal becomes effective only at the next reaction.

This presentation shows that objects and methods enter in a rather natural way into the broadcast event driven approach, although different in spirit from it as method calls are not broadcast but sent to precise targets. Reactive scripts give both ways of programming in an unified framework.

The bindParams method checks that there is the same number of actual and formal parameters, and if it is the case, for each parameter, it changes the instruction body into an InputDecl, and OutputDecl, or an InOutDecl, according to the parameter type.

Interpretor extends RsiMachine and defines two flags next and runInterp. To set next to true forces immediate reaction for the next instant, as soon as current instant is over. To set runInterp to true forces the interpretor to run the program.

Reactive Scripts ``external statements'' are used to interact with the external system (for data management, graphic interactions, etc.). To implement this in Java, we build a mechanism that allows Java objects to register themselves as external objects on which reactive scripts can invoke methods through external calls. Please remark that we donot take advantage of the new features of Java 1.1 such asintrospection, to be able to use our package on Java 1.0 Virtual Machines.

Each instance of Interpretor has a field which is an instance ofExternal and is used as an interface between reactive scripts and external Java objects. When an external statement is encountered, the string between braces is passed to this object as a parameter of the parseExpression method. While parsing, when anidentifier is found, the External object checks if this identifier references a registered object (Javaobjects that implement the Selector interface have to registerthemself to the External instance, through the register method) and if so, calls the select method on this registered object with the method name and its parameters as arguments. Each implementation of the select method is responsible for the correct redirection to Java methods.

ExternNode is a typical example of External use to interact with Javaobjects. ExternNode implements Selector and has two methods, print and println. It must be subclassed to implement other methods. The System object defined in Interpretor is an instance of it (thus, System.out.println("") and System.out.print("") calls are correct).

We have implemented the rsi-java interpretor using SugarCubes in a straightforward way. Several sub-classes of Interpretor have also been defined mainly to disconnect the keyboard from the interpretor, to be able to enter new commands and new scripts while the interpretor is running.

The software platform for pricing and risk evaluation in finance will be developed using ProActive, and will make usage of machines forming Internet Grids or Global Computing Grids managed in a peer-to-peer fashion (aka desktop grids).

A first version for such a platform using ProActive already exists. The aim is to pursue its design and development. In particular, the postdoc should focus his/her research on the definition of adequate programming patterns (generic, adaptative, fault-resilient, highly performant) devoted to parallelism exploitation on computing grids for pricing of financial options, risk analysis. For the time being, only the ProActive programming for European options pricing, with and without barriers has been addressed. The postdoc should also devote time to Value at Risk calculation models, and hedge funds specificities.

We are expecting a young researcher skilled in distributed Java programming, while also already aware of the principles and computational methods required in mathematical finance (e.g such as Monte Carlo simulation techniques), and possibly also, skilled in the parallelisation of numerical methods.

It offers a unique opportunity to address scientifically challenging and industrially relevant problems in the setting of major contributors of Grid Computing in Europe. The global objective of the project is to mutualize efforts to add synergy to the existing critical mass in Europe. The overall goal is to build a european force to compete with american and asian proposals.

In this project, INRIA is leader of the workpackage named "enhanced collaboration among researchers and users of Grids" in which it is proposed to organize several workshops, promote and organize dissemination and develop a standardization strategy. The main vehicle for dissemination is a regularly updated web site containing a repository of information (namely available middlewares and grid curriculum).

The fault-tolerance protocol that has been implemented in ProActive does not support first class futures: the value of a future can only be re-sent to the sender of the associated request upon recovery. In other words, if the future has been automatically forwarded to a third process, this process will not receive the future value upon recovery.

This internship can be addressed both from a purely theoretical approach (focusing on the link between ASP calculus and events model, see bibliography below); and from a much more applied point of view that could consist, for example in designing and implementing an independent protocol for addressing future updates.

SAP contributions are to cover architecture specifications, application programming interfaces and to provide secure new designs and frameworks for mobile business applications. These contributions will allow the development and deployment of secure mobile applications.

Within the framework of a hierarchical component model and middleware, we want to study and to improve the construction of applications capable of dealing with open environments and hardware device discovery and adaptations. Declarative and deployement time security must be a feature. For instance, it should be possible to dynamically negociate security policies. Taking into account P2P services will have to be a key feature.

The PhD candidate, with a strong background in object-oriented languages, distributed programming, security issues, and software development, will have to participate in the design of the security infrastructure as well as in the building of a prototype for a use-case in Mosquito, in strong collaboration between INRIA and SAP Labs.

Logical properties of the system can be checked directly on the specification using model-checking tools. Then the specification pieces can (in principle) be compared with the models generated from the code of an implementation.

We are curently extending this works in the context of the ProActice/Fractal framework for distributed (hierarchical) components. In addition to having an activity (a behaviour), a ProActive component has non-fonctionnal features, including life-cycle (start/ stop), reconfiguration (dynamic replacement and rebinding), etc.

Policies express conditions for the management of the components lifecycle. We are developing methods and tools for specification and verification of safe componant-based applications, expressing the interplay of their functional and non-functional behaviour, and their possible dynamic reconfigurations.

Having a common model for the specification of the application or component, and for the behavioural semantic model is the basis of a sound principle for model generation. Conversely, we will use this model to generate parts of the implementation of components directly from the specification, in a way that will guarantee correctness properties w.r.t. the specification.

ADL that will express the static aspects of the composite components structure and bindings. Then the behavioural specification can be automatically implemented be code generation in a way that ensures correctness versus the component specification, and ultimately correctness of components composition.

Sophia-Antipolis develops tools for programming systems based on distributed components (ProActive library, implementing the Fractal component model), as well as tools for ensuring that assemblies of components behave correctly (the Vercors platform).

The Fractal model contains an Architecture Description Language (ADL), allowing the description of the structure of applications built from generic and reusable components. We have also proposed extensions to Fractal-ADL for attaching behaviour specification in the descriptions. But these languages are too low-level to be exposed to a non-expert developper. We intend to propose new languages, textual or graphical, that would be more abstract and easier to use.

Analyzing and implementing environment of verification and simulation is one issues among the LabSoC team interests (within the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications in Sophia). The team proposes and develops toolkit, named Turtle, based on the Turtle UML profile (cf. http://labsoc.comelec.enst.fr/turtle/), for the modeling of real-time systems. It offers an analysis and verification methodology that is different, but not too far, from what is available in the area of distributed components.

The aim of this internship is to study the Turtle profile and the TTool editor, and use them to specify an example of ProActive component system. In a second phase, the student will specify the behavior of the same example using another type of UML diagram, based on Statecharts, et will compare the two approaches.

Emulating Framework for Prototyped Services. For this last activity, the purpose is to develop a grid-based test-bed for testing the scalability of the designed framework in a hypothetical mass scale deployment. For this, ProActive, the distributed object and component oriented P2P and grid programming environment developed in OASIS, will serve as the basis.

The main goal of this internship is to propose solutions for the design of a framework for autonomic services. We propose to start the design by focusing on an adaptative component-oriented approach to distributed programming, like the Fractal component oriented model, that is implemented in ProActive. The goal of the internship is to extend this implementation by dynamic controllers implemented themselves as components , enabling to easily provide components with an autonomic behaviour. The particularity of this approach is that the autonomic behaviour is itself defined and configurable using components (besides, we seek also to evaluate if aspect orientation is required or not for the expression and enactement of the selfness behaviours that are targetted here).

This work may also yield to the design and integration of lightweight components, both compatible with ProActive Fractal components, but without all the features that ProActive provides, mainly without relying on an active object.

The Oasis team develops methods and tools for the analysis and the verification of applications built from distributed components. A central piece in these activities is the "model-checker", that checks whether a property is true in all possible states of the application behaviour. We currently use "classical" model-checkers, that are based on the explicite or symbolic enumeration of a finite state-space.

Independantly, several french research teams are working on the development of methods for the model-checking of infinite state-spaces, when this state-space has a regular structure (e.g. generated by stacks, fifos, or similar structures).

After a review of the current state of model-checking tools available, and in particular those offered by the PERSEE action (Altarica language and tool, Fast and TRex tools), the student will explore, using concrete Proactive case-studies, the possibility of using those tools. He/she will develop software connections between Oasis analysis tools and Persee model-checkers.

Distributed computing is moving from clusters to Grids and P2P. A cluster is rather easy to use due to its homogeneous nature and latitudinarian internal network policy. Grids and P2P networks involve multiple heterogeneous sites, probably not fully interconnected, and subject to various network or security policies. One big challenge with these environments is to be able to deploy and allow, efficient, communication between all workers. This Research Master proposes to tackle those difficult issues.

A typical workaround is to use a master/worker model. The master can reach all workers and each worker can reach the master. Workers do not, or cannot, talk between them. This solution is indeed very limiting, preventing many applications to be deployed and executed. Hierarchical deployment and message routing are an attempt to solve this issue by providing to users a transparent mechanism to allow bidirectional communications between each worker, whatever encountered network restrictions (firewall, NAT, private IPs etc.).

In the absence of any syntactical extension, ProActive programmers write standard code. The library is itself extensible by the programmers, using a MOP (Meta-Object Protocol), making the system open for adaptations and optimizations.

The prototype implementation and experimentations will take advantage of the ProActive platform, including the component capability, in order to benefit from asynchronous and group communication, high-level synchronization (Wait-by-Necessity), and graphical composition of components.

The overall objective of this research Master is to propose solutions for gaining the potential efficiency of active messages communications within the framework of high-level Grid environment, such as the ProActive library.

Makes easier the integration of new components on heterogeneous systems for numerical computation Sets the priority to multi-physics coupling between computation software Provides a generic user interface, user-friendly and efficient, which helps to reduce the costs and delays of carrying out the studies Reduces training time to the specific time for learning the software solution which has been based on this platform All functionalities are accessible through the programmatic integrated Python console.

The general context of this framework is components models. Our team is highly involved in the design of a Grid Component Model (GCM), which consists in a Grid-oriented extension of the Fractal component model.

In general in component programming, but even more specifically in distributed and Grid computing, components need to be highly adaptative, a great part of adaptativeness relies on reconfiguration of component systems, i.e. dynamically (during execution) bind, unbind, add and remove components.

Fractal defines "basic/predefined" controllers that should be present in most of Fractal components. We are interested here in binding, life-cycle, and content controllers (they allow to bind/unbind components, start/stop components, add/remove components inside another one). The primitives proposed in Fractal are sufficient for expressing any reconfiguration, but they are rather low-level.

According to the overall objectives of this ARC, we aim at proposing a solution for replication of J2EE application servers (in our case, we consider the open source ObjectWeb JONAS one): replication of J2EE servers on clusters of machines is already deeply studied; our objective is to extend replication in the context of grids of machines. The ProActive grid technology, developed in the OASIS group, will be used for giving a transparent and portable access to any sort of grid system.

The INRIA SARDES group develops JADE, an autonomic management software solution dedicated to J2EE replicated servers, but only within the scope of one cluster of machines. In JADE, there is a specific module responsible to provision additional machines from the cluster, onto which JADE can further decide to deploy server replicas. The subject we propose for the internship, is specifically concentrated on this module: the objective is to succeed to use the ProActive technology in order to provision machines that belong to a grid.

In the absence of any syntactical extension, ProActive PDC programmers write standard code. The library is itself extensible by the programmers, making the system open for adaptations and optimizations.

It might also be usefull to study the notion of future-based streaming in general, and or the use of dedicated buffered demand-driven computations in order to achieve implementation that fit within finite-size buffers.

The purpose of this talk is to give an introduction to the main challenges to achieve the integration of computing and data services across distributed and disparate computing, storage and visualization resources.

Grid computing is one example of distributed systems. As such it relies on standard networking and system technology. Its popularity comes from the fact that it is an  area of potentially big impact on many application domains : physical sciences, biology, environment, medical services,,...

It is also an area where the academic world can impact societal problems by bringing the possibility to solve larger and more complex problems. This input of the academic community can be of major importance at different levels: at the infrastructure level (how to interconnect efficiently distributed, heterogeneous, numerous, and volatiles computing  devices), at the software level (how to integrate, and ease the use of a large number of software services), at the application level (how to couple existing applications in order to solve multiphysics problems or to bridge the gap between data in different social areas).

Executing multiple isolates with a single virtual machine can improve performance and scalability, while decreasing failures. Implementing such a model poses various challenges. In this work we consider the issue of providing a fast inter-application communication mechanism. In addition to being efficient, such a mechanism should not violate any functional and non-functional properties of its environment, and should also support enforcement of application-specific security policies. We explore the design and implementation of a communication substrate for Isolates. Designing an efficient extension that does not break isolation properties and at the same time pragmatically offers an intuitive API has proven non-trivial.  We present a set of techniques that lead to at least an eight-fold performance improvement over Java remote Method Invocation.

It's necessary to know the effective network topology, as systems may be alive or not, temporarily disconnected, etc. In order to accomplish his/her task, the system administrator needs to have the knowledge of the dynamic evolution of its network topology.

In order to ease the programming of customized system and network management tasks, we have developed a library through which different kind of itineraries may be defined. For instance, such itineraries allow to mix locations for which either a local or a remote SNMP-based operation must be executed, and locations whose aim would only be to host the (mobile) agent arriving from a remote network.

We study a method for proving behavioural properties for distributed Java applications inside which objects on different setting cooperate by remote method calls. ProActive library provides high level primitives that ease the programming of those distributed applications.

In this paper, we give a method for constructing finite behavioural models for distributed Java applications, building the assumption without the dynamic creation of objects. We display, how by involving some finite approximation of the actif object depict closely his behaviour. Analysis of the application's properties (search of deadlock, safety properties) can be leaded on this compositionnels finite models, using verification toolsets based on behavioural semantic by bisimulation.

In order for this approach to fully work, while component libraries become available, it is necessary to be able to compose existing components into more complex objects, and to guarantee that this composition will work correctly and fulfill its expected role.

Gathering teams specialized in behavioural specifications of components, languages and models for distributed, mobile, and communicating application programming, and methods and tools for compositional verification, the goal of FIACRE is to design methods and tools for specification, model extraction, and verification of distributed, hierarchical, and communicating components.

Definition of languages to specify properties and component behaviours, which must be adapted to verify distributed applications and allow an easy translation into the low-level formalisms that are used for verification, and into distributed application skeletons (for model based code generation).

This necessitates to fight against state explosion to verify large systems, using in particular techniques such as partial orders or compositional verification,  or through the use of techniques dedicated to parameterized or infinite  systems.

We present a development environment for parallel object-oriented programming. It provides visual tools to develop and debug object-oriented programs as well as parallel or concurrent systems. This environment was derived from a structural operational semantics of Java.

In this example, we can see that the identifiers of the objects are in blue. A programmer can know at first sight if the considered object is a thread or not thanks to the thread status which appears in green (e. g. the threads #0 and #2). This window presents the activity of the threads through a continuation and an execution environment, the fields of each object: for example "contents" and "available" which have both the value 0 for the object #1.

Our graphical presentation enables the programmer to easily envision the object list topology and its evolution during program execution. It represents the object list using a graph where nodes represent objects and arrows are references between objects.

In current and actual systems, there are many threads, objects, and as such, many complex interactions between them. A solution used to tackle complexity relies on summary views of objects and threads.

For example we can see that thread #2 is executing a method on object 3 and within this method, the thread executes another method call on object #4 then on object #1 and on the object #3 again. This represents an indirect method call.

A crucial problem when writing concurrent applications is to know where synchronizations have to be placed. It is therefore very useful to figure out concurrent accesses to objects. For each object of the system, including threads, our environment gives all the threads that are currently accessing it. The lower part of the above window exhibits that the object #3 is currently accessed by the threads #6, #5, and #2.

Consumer #2 becomes "dormant" (purple color and linked to the CubbyHole lock by a D-arrow) because it has locked the CubbyHole before the Producer #4 has put a value in it (and therefore has no value to read).

The goal of this study is to build an environment based upon the formal semantics of the Java Card language, using the Centaur system. With this latter tool, we have defined the Java Card syntax useful for the structured Java Card program edition and we have specified a source code interpretor based on the semantics that simulates the behavior of Java Card applets before loading on a card.

The objective of this thesis is to design an object calculus that allows one to write parallel and distributed applications, particularly on wide range networks, while ensuring good properties. This calculus is named ASP: Asynchronous Sequential Processes.

Measuring the Internet (e.g., traffic, topology, availability) and analyzing the collected data is a key issue in understanding the performance of the network and in improving the service provided to end users and to ISPs. Measurements are essential to develop and validate models for Internet traffic and for the behavior of Internet users and protocols. They are also essential to detect anomalies in the network, to optimize the tuning of protocols, to assist in network dimensioning and provisioning, to assess the QoS perceived by users and ISPs and whether they respect their traffic specifications or no, etc. One interesting application of measurements is to collect the information exchanged by Internet routing protocols and to infer a logical topology of the Internet that helps in optimizing the routing of packets and in detecting misbehaving entities. The challenges in this field are numerous, we cite for example: heterogeneity of the Internet, security issues, mobility issues, the large volume of collected data, the fast change of Internet traffic, the diversity of network managers and operators.

TCP is the mostly used transport protocol in the Internet. This protocol is known to have problems in heterogeneous environments as wireless, satellite, fast long-distance networks, asymmetric networks, etc. The number of these environments challenging to TCP is always increasing. The problem is and will always be how to enhance the TCP protocol so that it can perform well over most, if not all, heterogeneous networks.

The implosion at the collector and the congestion of the network are avoided by controlling the rate of sending probes. The congestion control part of TICP is designed with the main objective to be friendly with applications using TCP.

TICP uses a clustering mechanism allowing it to gather sources behind same bottleneck together. It probes sources from the nearest to the most distant from the collector in terms of RTT. This ensures a smooth variation of network conditions and hence, an efficient congestion control.

With the new version of the protocol, it is possible to collect large amounts of data from each information source. Our experimentations prove that the performances of TICP are better than using parallel TCP connections for the collection.

Recently we have studied the impact of delegating collection to a subset of information sources on the performances of TICP. We proved that for a well-chosen number of proxy collectors, one could gain dramatically in collect session duration.

Overview  Since the early days of the internet, from the email to the Web, the client-server architecture has been used for data transfer. However, in a few years, the peer-to-peer architecture has changed our way to share information. At the present time, peer-to-peer communications account for between 40% to 80% of the internet backbone traffic. The peer-to-peer architecture deployment has followed a rare model in the history of the internet. Whereas, most of the time, even the smallest improvement requires years of academic evaluations and experimentations, before a real large scale deployment, the peer-to-peer applications were deployed at large scale based on an empirical process. The understanding of these new applications is incipient and starts to be a very active research area.

This project focus on the understanding and improvement of peer-to-peer content delivery. Indeed, we believe that the value of peer-to-peer comes from its ability to distribute contents to a large number of peers without any specific infrastructure, and within a delay that is logarithmic with the number of peers.

We have performed [LUM_IMC06] and experimental evaluation of BitTorrent, which is the only one popular peer-to-peer protocol to focus on efficient content delivery. We evaluated its two core mechanisms: its piece selection mechanism called rarest first, and its peer selection algorithm called choke algorithm.  We show that the rarest first algorithm guarantees a diversity of the pieces among peers close to the ideal one. In particular, on our experiments, a replacement of the rarest first algorithm with a source or network coding solution cannot be justified. We also show that the choke algorithm in its latest version fosters reciprocation and is robust to free riders. In particular, the choke algorithm is fair and its replacement with a bit level tit-for-tat solution is not appropriate.

Focusing on the properties of the choke algorithm [LLKZ_06], we showed that it enables clustering of similar-bandwidth peers, ensures effective sharing incentives by rewarding peers who contribute with high download rates, and achieves high upload utilization for the majority of the download duration. We also examined the properties of the new choke algorithm in seed state and the impact of initial seed capacity on the overall BitTorrent system performance. In particular, we showed that an underprovisioned initial seed does not enable clustering of peers and does not guarantee effective sharing incentives. However, we showed that even in such a case, the choke algorithm guarantees an efficient utilization of the available resources by enforcing fast peers to help other peers with their download. Based on our observations, we offered guidelines for content providers regarding seed provisioning, and discussed a tracker protocol extension that addresses an identified limitation of the protocol.

However, in a few years, the peer-to-peer architecture has changed our way to share information. At the present time, peer-to-peer communications account for between 40% to 80% of the internet backbone traffic.

The peer-to-peer architecture deployment has followed a rare model in the history of the internet. Whereas, most of the time, even the smallest improvement requires years of academic evaluations and experimentations, before a real large scale deployment, the peer-to-peer applications were deployed at large scale based on an empirical process. The understanding of these new applications is incipient and starts to be a very active research area.

Chaos is a prominent feature of complex systems and dynamical systems theory provides methods for analyzing this kind of behavior. Computer networks are complex systems, but it is not yet known whether Internet protocols exhibit chaotic behaviors though some preliminary investigations suggest it. Understanding the meaning and effect of such behaviors is a scientific challenge, with the potential of a significant impact, especially concerning applications based, e.g., on chaos control, or resonances in chaotic systems. For this, one needs first, on the one hand, to design models describing properly the dynamic evolution of a computer network using an Internet protocol, and to make the mathematical analyzis of these models. On the other hand, one must perform careful investigations on real protocol traces, to analyze them with the tools developped in chaos theory, and to compare them to the predictions of the models. This is the goal of the Ph.D. thesis that we propose. Since the candidate will have to work at the border between computer science and mathematical physics, a good skill in these two fields is required.

France, we always welcome applications from highly talented and motivated students. We ask from our Ph.D. students an international visibility with publications is the best international journals and conferences.

Everything I wanted to know about C.S. graduate school at the beginning but didn't learn until later, by Ronald T. Azuma (original URL) Another must read before starting a Ph.D. thesis. A small excerpt from this document: The most basic question every Ph.D. student must know the answer to is: "Why the hell am I doing this?" [...]If you do not have an acceptable answer to this question, then don't get a Ph.D. I repeat: if you do not have a rock-solid reason for getting the Ph.D., then it is better that you leave with a Master's.

Multicast congestion control is a complex problem. However, a well designed multicast congestion control protocol is fundamental to the deployment of a multicast service. The major constraint while designing multicast congestion control protocols is the TCP-friendly constraint. The problem is that TCP-friendliness is not well adapted to large scale multicast sessions. When the protocol is source based, the TCP-friendliness is a real performance issue on large heterogeneous sessions. When the protocol is receiver based, TCP-friendliness is not well defined and lead to suboptimality.

We decided to explore alternatives to the TCP-friendly paradigm. Although this approach cannot offer a viable solution at short term, it offers an alternative to and a better understanding of the TCP-friendly paradigm. We introduced the notion of FS-paradigm. This paradigm relies heavily on previous works of Keshav and Shenker, but has a new focus on the general design of congestion control protocols. With the assumption of Fair Queuing in the network, we show that we can define nearly ideal end-to-end congestion control protocols. At first sight, the FS-paradigm statement seems pretty philosophical and difficult to apply. Indeed, it does not offer a practical solution to the problem of the design of congestion control protocols. However, it sheds a new light on the issues raised by TCP-friendliness and on alternatives to this TCP-friendly paradigm.

It is clear that most of the good properties of PLM comes from the FQ network. However, even in a FQ network neither RLM nor RLC come close the PLM. Therefore this work has shown the importance of the bandwidth inference mechanism. The TCP-friendly paradigm imposes a bandwidth inference mechanism based on losses. We have shown that we can achieve a better efficiency with another class of bandwidth inference mechanisms.

PLM is already included into your ns version. If you have a version of ns former than the July 24, 2000 daily snapshot, you need to follow the procedure below in order to integrate PLM into your ns version.

Disclaimer: The following list was originally written for my personal use and is therefore necessarily biased towards my areas of particular interest and expertise.

If you would like to have yourself included in the list, or if something needs to be updated, please let me know.

This pioneering application allowed me to evaluate new congestion control algorithms in real conditions. In a nutshell, in best effort IP networks, since there is no guarantee of packet delivery (packet loss), delay and jitter, the application has to be adaptive. In particular, multimedia applications have to implement their own congestion control algorithms to adapt their transmission rate to the variable available bandwidth. With Jean Bolot and Ian Wakeman, we have designed one of the first multicast congestion control mechanisms for real-time videoconferencing over the Internet.

With Jean, we designed several flavours of such congestion control algorithms including TCP-friendly algorithms. I continued this work in collaboration with Christine Guillemot and Kav Salamatian, focusing on how to improve these mechanisms in the presence of multiple heterogeneous receivers.

Because native multicast is not available everywhere (euphemism :-), many people have proposed overlay solutions to provide multicast-like delivery service. With Vijay Arya and Shivkumar Kalyanaraman, we have proposed techniques to encode multicast trees within packets. Then, with Torsten Braun and Vijay, we have designed a backup multicast tree algorithm to improve the reliability of multicast delivery.

This algorithm has been implemented in a library that will be soon available in the public domain along with wrappers for various multimedia applications (vic, rat, vlc). We have also studied how to extend it to mobile ad hoc environments.

I had a few contributions on network tomography, especially concerning the MINC tool with my PhD student Vijay Arya – actually he was the main investigator of these works. Basically, we have designed mechanisms to make MINC more robust against possible misbehaving nodes and other mechanisms to reduce the amount of feedback sent.

These days, my works in this area focus on how to take advantage of software radio, in particular, because it is now possible to adapt all the layers of the communication protocol stack (including the PHY layer), how to design efficient cross-layer mechanisms. For example, with Hossein Manshaei, we have designed an algorithm to select the PHY mode of 802.11 stations that takes into account both the wireless channel characteristics and the intrinsic characteristics of the application (e.g. for video streaming, the loss tolerance of the video decoder).

Divine project, we are also investigating on how to improve the multicast transmission in WLANs. This work has started with Wolf Lauppe's Ecole Polytechnique Engineer internship. Then, with Diego Dujovne, Jose Villalon and Yongho Seok, we have proposed possible solutions.

Engineering and Physical Science Research (Schapiro CEPSR) is at the northern end of Columbia University's Morningside Campus. The building is on 120th street, between Broadway and Amsterdam, about half-way down the block on the south side. Entering the building from 120th Street, you will come through a set of iron gates. Right in front of the gate there is an elevator that will take you to the 4th floor, where the Davis Auditorium is located. (Please note that elevator won't be available on Sunday reception, April 25th. Please use the steps. On top of the step is the Davis Auditorium) To reach the offices and labs on the 7th and 8th floors, you will need to change elevators on the fourth floor.

Rodeo is a contrived acronym that stands for ``High speed networks, open networks''. The main objective of the project is to design, implement, and evaluate mechanisms for the efficient and flexible use of network resources.

Our emphasis these past few years have been on mechanisms that integrate multicast delivery, flexible flow and error control, etc. These mechanisms are used in particular in the FreePhone Internet telephony tool, in the Rendez-Vous videoconferencing tool (successor of IVS, one of the first s/w videoconferencing tool for the Internet) , and in the MiMaze distributed game.

Previous research in the group led to the development of the MAVROS compiler, and of fast algorithms for the management of data transparency in heterogeneous systems. We are extending this work so as to allow the compiler to handle detailed specifications of the applications. This will lead to further optimizations.

It will then be possible to take into account specifications of an application, of the network ressources required by the application, and to automatically generate tailored communication modules that handle both data transparency, synchronization, and transmission control for this application.

Modelling, design, and performance analysis of wireless, mobile, and sensor networks. My current research focuses on Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks. The goal of this work is the design, analysis, and performance evaluation of efficient routing schemes for Intermittently Connected Mobile Networks. I have also worked on the design and performance evaluation of efficient MAC and routing protocols for wireless networks using directional and smart antennas. Finally, I’ve also done some work on Active Networks and distributed algorithms for self-organization in sensor networks.

Quality of Service (QoS) is the ability of a network element (e.g. an application, host or router) to have some level of assurance that its traffic and service requirements can be satisfied. To enable QoS requires the cooperation of all network layers from top-to-bottom, as well as every network element from end-to-end. Any QoS assurances are only as good as the weakest link in the chain between sender and receiver. QoS does not create bandwidth. It isn't possible for the network to give what it doesn't have, so bandwidth availability is a starting point. QoS only manages bandwidth according to application demands and network management settings, and in that regard it cannot provide certainty if it involves sharing.

Resource reservation (integrated services): network resources are apportioned according to an application's QoS request, and subject to bandwidth management policy. RSVP provides the mechanisms to do this [IntServ].

Prioritization (differentiated services): network traffic is classified and apportioned network resources according to bandwidth management policy criteria. To enable QoS, classifications give preferential treatment to applications identified as having more demanding requirements. [DiffServ] provides this service. These QoS protocols and algorithms are not competitive or mutually exclusive, but on the contrary, they are complementary. As a result, they are designed for use in combination to accommodate the varying operational requirements in different network contexts.

Because, one user gets a better service than another, QoS requires policy enforcement that will require a policy management infrastructure. Since QoS provides added value, implies a need for accounting and billing infrastructure. It is not possible to enforce policy unless the identities of network users is not established. It should assign a level of trust. This implies a need for an authentication infrastructure.

Applications, network topology and policy dictate which type of QoS is most appropriate for individual flows or aggregates. To accommodate the need for these different types of QoS, there are a number of different QoS protocols and algorithms.

Internet routing protocols and their working environments, especially IP multicast routing architecture and the deployment including implementations of IP multicast capable kernel and user code, are my research topics.

The amount of redundancy included in each packet can be chosen in a manual, semi-automatic, or automatic fashion. In automatic mode, Free Phone automatically selects the amount of redundancy needed to keep the loss rate after reconstruction between some watermarks specified by the user [3].

If you have any problem using Free Phone over the platforms we think we support, please do tell us (please make sure to indicate the hardware/OS you are using). If the program just exits, run fphone with the option `-d 1', this will turn on some debug messages, please send me those messages as well in your report.

Phone internally sets the hardware to the best configuration (i.e. 16 bits, stereo, 48 KHz) and then do under/over-sampling and mono/stereo conversions to send the packets as requested (e.g. mono, 8 KHz) and converts what is received to the internal configuration. Free Phone now frees the audio devices (rec/play) while idle.

This release contains a hack to allow the distributed game MiMaze to stablish a connection with Free Phone which accepts it without any negotiation. This is just to allow the game talk with Free Phone up to the time some better mechanism is defined and implemented.

This release supports the Internet draft draft-perkins-rtp-redundancy-04.txt and hence achieves compatibility with RAT 2.6a14 (or later). That means this release is not backwards compatible with previous releases of Free Phone which encapsulate redundancy with a different scheme. In the absence of redundancy or high quality audio, all releases of Free Phone are compatible.

A new scheme to manage redundancy and high quality audio has been implemented using the special RTP payload types 37 and 38. A consequence of this is that versions 2.0 b2 and above are not compatible with earlier versions (that relied on the extension bit to encode redundant information).

RecentMsgRecord We need a separate record to keep track of old demotion messages so that the same msg is not forwarded more than once. We cant use the potl children or potl parent list for this because the entry is deleted on demotion.

SatRouteObject A global route computation object/genie   This class performs operations very similar to what "Simulator instproc compute-routes" does at OTcl-level, except it performs them entirely in C++.  Single source shortest path routing is also supported.

Two application	can only communicate if	they have  a  common knowledge of the "abstract syntax" of the messages that	they will exchange. The OSI model does not constrain	them to	 use the same binary	representation,	as this	would probably imply using the same hardware	platform as well as  the  same	programming  languages and	the same compilers. In order to	communicate, the messages must be encoded in  a  binary  format agreed by both parties.

A typical feature of ASN.1, different from most	 other	programming  languages,  is the very frequent use of "top down" notations: it is quite natural,	when writing specifications, to specify first the "upper level" elements, like "Modem" in our example, and to specify then the  "components"  included in  the	box. While this	feature	makes the specification	more readable, it does indeed not simplify the task of  the	compiler...

Special	values can be defined for every	type, whatever	complex. These values can be used in documentations of communication protocols; they can also	be  used  in  the  "DEFAULT" clause,	 to specify that when optional elements	of a message are "absent" on	the transmission wires the recipient  should act  as	 if  it	had received the "default" value. This imply the necessity to detect	the default values in order  not  to encode	them,  and  to	be able	to copy	them in	the received messages.

Moreover, he would also	have liked to use the  knowledge  of the  macro  in	order  to build	"automatically"	the table of attributes. This table is probably not	only  used  for	 the coding and decoding routines, but perhaps also by some parts of the application program, e.g. to check  whether  this  or that comparison	operation is allowed for the attribute.

The "light weight" syntax has been developped in a  research project	 at  INRIA.  It	 can  be negociated by knowledgeable presentation layers, and result	in significant reduction  of the coding and decoding	time between compatible	machines, in particular when	the syntax is oriented	towards	 "computing" applications,	with  lot  of  integers	 or  floating  point numbers.

The text versions can also be  used  in	 logging  files.  In fact, one can very easily use text from	a logging file,	edit it to include particular difficulties, and  obtain  a  "test suite" for a particular	program.

ASN.1  encoding	 is perturbated	by randomly changing some of the octest that	it contains. After  each  perturbation,	 the decoding routine are tested: they should detect	an error and terminate properly. This mimic the situation  of  a  network connection  where data can be incorrectly copied in a relay, or  improperly	generated  by  a  remote  application;	such incorrect  behaviour  should not be allowed to cause a fatal termination of a network server, and will be detected by the consistency checks of the decoding routines.

"Imported-3.asn1" and try to find that file in the current working directory. It will signal an error if the file cannot be found, and will then try to take default actions for handling the imported types and values. In some cases, e.g. if the imported type is used to produce a local value, the default actions cannot be applied succesfully and an error will be reported.

Use the name text_file for the text file that will contain the "knowledge" extracted from the MACRO instantiations present in the module. By default, the name of this file is constructed by appending the string .macros to the name of the module, e.g.

Some programmers have observed that this could result in very inefficient memory allocations when the maximum size is a very large number. By using the -seqofsize option, one can request that dynamic allocation be applied to lists which have a size greater than number.

The cross referencing of modules is hasardous: it supposes that exactly the same "C parametrization", e.g. that -static or -noflags were used in the different modules. One should be able to look at the definitions in the MAVROS inputs for these modules (*.mvr files), in order to extract the correct typing of the attributes.

The code generator MAVROS is the second pass of the "mavros" compiler. It translates the description of the data types, operations and errors, whose syntax is given in annotated ASN.1 in the file named input_filename into a set of C procedures for encoding and decoding the described data types.

Mavros has several options, which describe the source file, the type of routine that should be generated and the way these routines should be grouped into files. A set of miscellaneous arguments can be used for introducing debugging information, and also for various code parametrizations.

Each module of the list will be referenced in the make file module.make, so that they get compiled at the same time as the coding procedures, and get inserted in the module library. When the preprocessor mavcod is used, one should specify here the name of the "module_init.c" file generated by this program.

Is an optional list of files that will have to be included in the MAVROS result, e.g. in order to define special data types. Note that MAVROS will automatically reference in the module.h file the header file "asn1.h" describing the run time library, as well as the header files describing the imported ASN.1 modules. This option could be used if one wants to specify a particular order of reference between the modules.

I "line" commands similar to those of the C preprocessor in the generated source. When this command is not used, the error messages generated by the C compiler refer to the ".mvr" file; if it is used, they refer to the C file.

Assume that the programmer is aware of the 1993 "type extensibility" notation, i.e. that types which can be extended are explicitly described. In this case, MAVROS will generate an error detection for unexpected elements occuring in a non extensible "sequence", instead of merely ignoring them.

Generate one global preprocessor definition for the named integer values and named bit string value. This is problematic, as preprocessor definitions have a global scope in C, while named values have only a local scope in ASN.1.

For every data type, MAVROS will generate four 'C' procedures for the basic coding and decoding functions, a subtype verification routine, plus optionally text coding and  decoding routines, copying, comparison and hashing routines.

The argument area_limit gives the limit of the buffer to be decoded; it is used by syntax checking routines during the decoding procedure. If an error occurs, the decoding routine returns a null pointer; the location of the byte which was being decoded can be found in the global variable asn1_wrongbyte, and an error code in the global variable asn1_diagnostic.

One must pass to the coding routine a pointer to an area of sufficient size to hold all the encoded information. The routine XXXXXX_len , called with exactly the same arguments as XXXXXX_cod will return a closed overevaluation of the size of the ASN-1 encoding.

They will not necessarily return an exact evaluation, as this would involve too much processing: for example, for encoding an integer, MAVROS will reserve four bytes, even if the coding will use from 1 to 4 bytes depending on the actual value.

"subtype constraints" such as specification of string or table sizes, ranges for INTEGERs, sets of acceptable values, allowed characters in strings. These constraints are not checked at decoding time. The function XXXXXX_stp will return a non null value if the constraints are met, a null value otherwise.

Parse the null terminated area and set the result in the argument list, which has the same format as that of the ASN.1 decoding routines. The argument area_limit points to the end of the encoding buffer, and is used for syntax checking. In case of error, the routine returns a null pointer; the global variable asn1_wrong_input_char holds the location of the character where the error was decoded, and the global variable asn1_input_diagnostic holds the error code, which can be transformed in a text string by the routine asn1_errdec .

There is no specific memory deallocation routine for the text syntax. The routine XXXXXX_free should be used to release the memory allocated during the decoding, when the data are not anymore needed. It should also be used after an error detection.

This may not yeld the expected results, except if the data have been produced by a decoding or a copying procedure: MAVROS uses its own memory allocation procedures, described in the asn1_malloc manual.

MAVROS may decide to encode some procedures by using macros rather than actual procedures. When one needs a real function, e.g. to insert it in a table of functions, this can be prevented by declaring the type in the list of exported variables, in the MAVROS input.

Transforms the string s into an object id. The value of the object id will point to a static buffer, and will be overwrited by the next call.  The routine asn1_oid_copy can be used to create allocate the necessary memory, and the macro asn1_oid_create do to so in a single pass..  In case of error, the length and value components of oid are set to zero, and the return argument er contains the number of the error; it can be explained by the function asn1_ermes.

The Universal time format is defined as a character string, made of the year, month, day, hour, minute and optionally secunds. It can be completed by a time differential between the local time and the UTC time, or by the letter Z, to denote the absence of any differential. The generalized time format is an evolution of the UTCtime, completed by an arbitrarily precise decimal fraction of a secund.

"P" definitely isn't prime. But if the algorithm reports 25 times in a row that "P" is "probably prime", we can say that "P" is "almost surely prime". For the probability is less than (1/4)**25 that such a 25-times-in-a-row procedure gives the wrong information about "P". This is less than one chance in a quadrillion.

Asn1_free will take no action if the pointer to be freed is not present in the hashed list, i.e. was not allocated by asn1_malloc or was already freed by asn1_free; it will call free and remove the pointer from the list otherwise.

It can be used when debugging complex applications, e.g. to check that a server is not silently crunching all the available memory... If the pointer add is non null, asn1_alloc_snap_shot will fill it with a pointer to the list of addresses currently referenced in the hashed table. That area which holds that list is allocated by means of malloc and should indeed be freed in due time.

ASN-1 defined syntaxes. This document list the various components of the software, and gives information on the various algorithms which have been implemented within these components. It contains information on the compiler itself, on the library routines, on the test procedures and on the porting procedures.

A main module, responsible of reading the program arguments and the execution flags, A module responsible of decoding the input, which interfaces with yacc and lex, A module containing the pretty printing routines.

The MAVROS input is parsed by using lex and yacc generated programs, which call routines of the module mavrospro.c in order to build a representation in memory of the input. The input is then checked for consistency, and can be displayed by a pretty printer. It will be used by the code generation routines, which are made easier to write by the availabity of a number of ancillary routines.

The lex syntax is defined in the file mavros.lex, and the yacc grammar in the file mavros.gr. The routines of mavros.gr call some routines in mavrospro.c in order to build in memory a tree representing the input.

The printing of the each type is handled by the routine type_print, which will first print type name and its calling arguments, and will then print the definition itself by using the routine printcomp.

The main part of the routine is a switch based on the component type. The type of the component will be printed first, followed by sonme type specific indications, e.g. for CHOICE or SET OF; if the component is structured, its members will be print by calling recursively printcomp.

The routine argprint prints out an argument to a procedure. The m flag indicates whether the argument should be passed by value (m=0) or by address (m=1). The correct printing requires a knowledge of the calling mode, indicated in the global variable current_call_mode, and of the current declarations, which are derived from calling list of the current element, identified by the global variable current_list_head.

The coding routines for ASN-1 include a flag. By convention, this flag is encoded first, by a single instruction, or is similarly decoded -- if it is known, and if the particular type allows for that treatment.

The termination for this specific routines (or macros) will be "_vcod" or "_vdec", by opposition to the straight coding and decoding. Coding macros will take then a coding argument (z), and decoding macros two (z, zmax).

The number of parameters is a parameter of the routine type. In principle, all parameters take the mode defined by the calling type, with the exception of the FLAGS were the second argument is a constant.

In order to generate properly the (argument_list), one will search the declaration of the element in the "component list", and one will determine for each argument its mode: by address or by value -- the default mode depending of the "callmode".

The routines can also be called in a "include" mode, in order to generate the call list of "include" declarations. In that case, neither the (name) or (suffix) components are printed, nor the parenthesis; also, one should not generate any comments, even in debug mode.

Error handling routine is directly associated to that of the ASN.1 basic encoding and decoding routines. The corresponding code is included in the file mavrosgen.c. The copying routine generation code is present in the file mavroscpy.c, the comparison code in the file mavrosxxx.c.

The decoding routine do allocate memory, in order to copy in this memory the elements that they decode. The memory liberation routine will desallocate all the memory blocs that had prior been allocated.

The procedure frcomp will be called for all components. The test fr_something_to_free tells whether a given element may or may not include memory allocations. One note that for all dubious cases, i.e. elements which are imported and elements of type field, the test returns true.

The components of type field, i.e. octets and bit strings, object identifiers and elements of type any can be either allocated or pointed in the decoding buffer. As the copying routines will always allocate memory, the memory desallocator is always called.

The ANY DEFINED BY construct poses an interesting freeing problem. In order to determine the structure of the variable component, hence the type of memory liberation that shall be applied, one must free these components before any attempt to free the other elements. It is thus necessary to develop a specific routine for all these variables, called free_anydef.

The error handling routines are complementary to the memory allocation routines. They are called by the decoding routines when an error is detected, in order to replace the missing data by some realistic value; they will in particular garantee that memory liberation routines can execute properly.

The procedure errcomp will be called for each component. If needed, it will perform some memory allocation for each of these components. It will also perform the initialisation of variables requested by the INITIAL close. Then, it will perform some component specific action, and end up by performing the instructions specified by the FINAL close.

For each component of an ASN.1 structure, the routine cpy_comp will be called. This routine will first generate the necessary memory allocations and initialisations of the target component, and will then switch to type specific actions, before generating the final initialisations of the target.

The comparison of sequences is equal to the comparison of all their components. The first components of a sequence are considered ``most significant'' for the ordering relation. When a sequence includes optional components, two values will be considered equal if the optional element is absent from both, or if it is present in both with equal values.

This is in fact incorrect as long as the SET OF type is concerned, as two such arrays should be equal regardless of the order of their components. A more precise comparison procedure will be implemented in a further release.

There is a little difficulty in testing the equality of the alternatives when the choice can be ``defaulted'', as the default branch is taken when the selector has any value except one of the defined branches...

When the coding of the component is completed, one programs a call to the end of component coding routine, which takes two parameters: the location of the last byte, and the location of the length. This is generated by either closeasncod or closeasnset. Note that the routine generates a call through a pointer, asn1_end or asn1_end_set, so that the coding of the length field can be tailored to the needs of the application, e.g. allowing or not the undefined value for the length field.

The coding of the external tag is performed by the seqcod routine, which calls the seqbodycod routine for coding the elements of the set or sequence. For named elements, we will generate two procedures: XXX_cod for coding the element itself, and XXX_ccod for coding its components.

The coding of this constructs is performed by the routine arraycod. It consists in the coding of the tag, followed by a for construct with the index and limits specified in the annotated ASN.1 file, inside which MAVROS generates the coding of the repeated element.

The length of the tag field depend of the tag number, and is computed by the routine asn1codlen. The length of the length field is set by default to three bytes, e.g. a one byte undefined length field plus a two bytes end of component mark.

The routine seqlen generates instructions in order to compute the length of a set or sequence as the sum of the length of the external tag plus that of each component. If a component is optional, the same test is generated as in the coding routines.

The routine arraylen generates a for construct, so that the length of the set or sequence of component is generated as the sum of the length of the external tag plus the length of each occurence of the component.

The computation of the length of the basic components is computed by ad-hoc routines: the length of strings varies with the actual length of this string, whilst the length reserved for scalar types is a majorant of the coding length.

The generation of the decoding instructions for an ASN.1 component is performed by calling for each component the routine dccomp, which will handle the explicit tag if it exists, and which will then call the routine dccompbis. This routine will at first generate the initialisations and memory allocations necessary to the component, by calling the routines dcalloc and dcinit, then execute a switch, which will trigger a call to the generation of the proper decoding for the component type. Finally, the final initialisations, if required, will be generated by calling dcinit.

Asn1z contains the current location, and asn1zm contains the address of the last byte of the decoding buffer. These variables are used through all the decoding programs, in order to detect decoding errors. If an error occurs, the variable asn1z will be set to a null value.

The decoding of the length field is only performed in the case of structured elements. This is done by generating a call to the routine asn1_length, which returns the new value of asn1z and which fills in its third parameter the new buffer limit, as derived from the length field.

The buffer limit is kept in a stack, asn1st, which is increased after each opening of a structured component. It can be null, if the length field was in the undefined format, in which case the buffer limit of the enclosing component will be used.

When a component is closed, the routine asn1_close has to be called in order to check the proper closure, e.g. that components of undefined length are terminated by an end of content mark, or that components of defined length have exactly the expected length. Then, the routine asn1_unstack shall be called in order to retrieve the previous value of asn1zm.

In order to decode a CHOICE component, one generates an initial if and a succession of else if statements: for each alternative of the choice, one will generate a test comparing the current tag with that of the alternative. If the test is true, the decoding of the component will be executed, and the index of the alternative will be affected to the choice variable. If none of the alternative is selected, a decoding error is detected (ASN1_ERR_CHOICE).

The test of the tag is more difficult for embedded choice components, as the tag can take any of the alternative values: this is dealt with by the matchchoice routine. Similarly, the test of components defined elsewhere in the module, or imported, can be difficult if this component happens to be an untagged CHOICE; the test is replaced by a call to XXX_asn1, as generated by matchextern.

The decoding of SETs is performed by the routine setdec. As the components of the sets can be encoded in any order, one has to generate a loop, i.e. to repeat while the pointer asn1z is inside the set a sequence of if and else ifs very similar to the decoding of a choice component. In order to test that all mandatory elements of the set are presents, one will first generate the initialisation of a table of booleans, asn1set, into which one location per component is reserved after the index asn1setc. After an element as been decoded, the corresponding location is set to 1, and the tag of that element is no longer looked for.

When the decoding of the set is completed, the table of booleans is examined, and the default action, is any, is taken for the missing optional elements. If some mandatory elements are missing, an error is detected.

The decoding routines for SETs is also used for components of sets. If a set refers to components of another set, the corresponding XXX_dec routines will be called, where asn1z points to the beginning of the set, and asn1zm to the corresponding buffer limit. This avoid duplication, but obliges us to ignore unexpected elements when decoding a set.

The handling of sequences is performed by the routine seqdec, which will decode the sequence's tag and then call the routine seqbodydec for decoding the sequence components. After decoding the components, it will generate a loop for ignoring unexpected components at the end of the sequence.

The decoding of the components is done by generating for each of these components a test. If the limit of the buffer has not been reached, and if the tag matchs, the decoding ionstruction will be executed; otherwise, the component will be considered as missing. If it was optional, default actions will be taken; if it was mandatory, a decoding error will be detected.

The handling of sets of and sequences of is performed by the routine arraydec, which will generate the decoding of the tag, and then a loop, in order to decode and count the components. After the loop, the number of components will be assigned to the tag limit.

The main purpose of the text coding routines is to provide extended logging and testing facilities, by printing a formated version of the output in a text file, or by loading text encoded messages in memory and sending them over the network. Indeed, a combination of these two facilities can be used interactively in a simple debugging interface.

A sequence or a set is represented as the concatenation of its components, enclosed in brackets and separated by commas. Identified components are represented by the concatenation of the identifier, and optional equal sign, and the value of the component. Unidentified components are represented by their value.

In most cases, the type tag of an element is specified in the ASN.1 module with the syntax of the element, and will be directly generated by MAVROS. In some cases, e.g. when a type is exported to a remote module and implicitly referenced, the tag must be compiled at run time. This is performed by the routine asn1_type_cod, which will take care of using exactly the number of octets required.

Finally, the length itself is encoded by the closing routine, which takes two parameters: the address of the octet reserved for the length field, and the address of the first octet following the encoding of the components. If the length of the element is less than 128 bytes, the length is stored in the reserved octet; otherwhise, and undefined length mark is placed in the reserved octet, and an end of content mark is encoded at the end of the content.

When the unique encoding is required, the value of asn1_end should be set to asn1_defined_end, and the value of asn1_end_set should be set to asn1_unique_set. These two routines are compatible with asn1_regular_end. The routine asn1_defined_end will encode the length field on exactly the number of octets required, pushing the value of the content by as many bytes to the right as required. The routine asn1_unique_set will copy the component into an intermediate storage, sort them using a simple bubble algorithm, and then reencode the fully defined length and the ordered content.

The general decoding routines include functions for manipulating the type tag (skiptype.c), for decoding the length field (lendec.c, length.c), for skipping an element (skip.c), for computing the number of elements in a structure (number.c), and for copying an element to a new position (move.c).

ASN.1 syntax of this element, and can point directly to the next field. In some cases however, for example with exported element which are implicitly tagged, one has to skip a variable length tag in order to point to the element length. This is performed by the asn1_skiptype routine, which will return an error (ASN1_ERR_TAG) if the tag exceeds the limit of the decoding buffer.

They differ by their parameter list, as one compute the length itself, whilst the other compute the address of the first byte following the content. Both will detect errors if the length is incorrectly encoded.

The routine asn1_close (length.c) Tests that the component is correctly terminated. It will return an error if the value is smaller than expected, or if the end of component mark was not present within the limit of the buffer, or if the end of component mark was improperly encoded.

The pointers design the first octet after the ebd of the element, or are null if the length is undefined. At any moment, the decoding routines use a pointer to the current buffer limit, which is either the end of the component itself, or the end of the structure containing the element, or the end of the received message. This pointer has to be recomputed after closing a structured element: this is done by the asn1_unstack procedure.

It may occur that the decoding routines generated by MAVROS detect an error, e.g. a missing or unexpected component. They will signal it by returning a null pointer instead of the pointer to the octet following the element, and they will place in the global variables asn1_wrongbyte and asn1_diagnostic the location and the code of the error. This can be done by calling the routine asn1_errdec (length.c).

There are many cases when the decoding routine have to skip an element and obtain a pointer to the following value. This is performed by the routine asn1_skip (skip.c); this routine will check the validity of the asn1 encoding of that element. The companion routine asn1_size will return the size of the element, obtained by skipping the element and substracting the address of the current pointer from that of the next pointer. The routine asn1_number (number.c) will open a component and count the number of embedded elements by using the asn1_skip routine.

The scalar types include the booleans, the integers, the enumerated integers and the reals. There is no specific routine for the coding and decoding of booleans: the necessary instructions are generated in line by MAVROS.

The file octmov.c contains the routine asn1_octmov, which moves an asn1 encoded octet string into a character string, the routine asn1_strmov which moves an asn1 encoded octet string into a null terminated character string, and the routine asn1_chars_dec for decoding an asn1 encoded character string.

In ASN-1, an octet string can be encoded following either the primitive format, i.e. as a string of bytes, or following the structured format, i.e. as a sequence of strings. The latter case is hard to use for C programs. Hence, the library contains procedures to pack all the substring in a single one, without extra memory allocation. These routines can be called from asn1_octets_dec; they are stored in the file octpak.c.

MAVROS, or is performed via simple macros. In some situations, one need a reference to a subroutine, e.g. for passing the address of the procedure in a table. The file libasn1.c contains the otherwise missing procedures, for the decoding of these types.

MAVROS can generate, as well as ASN.1 coding and decoding routines, a number of other types of procedures: light weight or textual encodings, copying routines. The ASN1 library contains the support functions for these procedures.

The object identifiers are handled by MAVROS as short octet strings. An object oid of type asn1_oid will contain a pointer to an octet area, oid.v, and the length of that octet string, oid.l. The octet string contains in fact the compact form used by ASN.1, which is easy to use for comparisons and sort operations.

The file oid.c contains several routines to convert from the external format to the internal format (asn1_oid_get) and vice versa (asn1_oid_put). It also contains a procedure for declaring an object identifier value asn1_oid_decl, which authorize the conversion procedures to use its name as an abreviation.

The routine asn1_gen_time will convert an UNIX representation into either a generalized time, if the millitm component is non null or an utc time otherwise. The routine asn1_utc_time will always convert to an UTC time, without fractions of seconds.

These routines maintain a list of allocated pointers, which is accessed through a hashing table maintained by static procedures. Asn1_alloc_free will take no action if the pointer to be freed is not present in the hashed list, i.e. was not allocated by asn1_alloc_malloc or was already freed; it will call free and remove the pointer from the list otherwise.

The routine asn1_alloc_snap_shot can be used to get the number of blocs which are represented in the hashing table at a given time, and optionally to obtain the content of the hashed table. It can be used when debugging complex applications, e.g. to check that a server is not silently crunching all the available memory...

For each element, the tag will be represented first, following the ASN.1 conventions. Then, if the element is primitive, the content will be represented either as a printable string if it consists of printable characters, or as an hexadecimal string otherwise; the character ampersand can be used as a continuation mark for long strings.

The routine load.c will read an element encoded as the output of asn1_dump from a file into memory. It can be used for simple debugging tools, e.g. in order to replay a session that was previously archived.

The tests shall be run in order to check the correctness of the porting of the ASN.1 library on a new system. They can be used as non regression tests after an update of either the MAVROS compiler or the ASN1 library.

The sequence seq2 is a simple redefinition of another sequence, called seq1. One should check that no coding routines are generated for seq2, but only C macros, making a direct reference to seq1. The sequence seq1 contains reference to a boolean, an integer, an OPTIONAL octet strings and two references to a set, set1. Indeed, the test cases will contain several occurences of this sequence, in particular in order to test the correct handling of optional components within sequences.

The set set4 is dedicated to the test of the COMPONENTS OF construct. It contain a direct inclusion of the components of the set set1, an a sequence component which consists solely of the components of the sequence seq3.

Different values will occur in the test suite, where the initial integer will sometime take a default value. The direct reference to choice1 is used to insert a decoding difficulty, i.e. the recognition of an untagged choice within a set.

The choice choice1 contains tagged and untagged integer components, an untagged choice component, which is again a difficulty for the decoding procedures, and a copy component, in order to test the delayed coding and decoding procedures.

One of the elements of the main choice, at the entry level, is an imported component called import1. The definition of the coding and decoding routines for that component are in the file import1.c; they code the integer parameter as a numeric string. The element is only present in order to test the import facility of MAVROS.

The first action of the test_mvr program is to load in memory a reference version of the data to encode, stored in the file test.input. The syntax of this file was choosen in order to make the loading routines as simple as possible, which does perhaps not result in the best level of readibility...

The type set4 comprises an element of type seq3 (a) followed by an element of type set1 (b). The element of type seq3 is composed of an  object identifier (a.oid) followed by a component of type any (a.any).

Bit strings are encoded as a string of hexadecimal characters delimited by simple quotes, just like octet string. However, the first two characters, which would encode the first byte of the octet string, encode here the number of unused bits in the last octet.

This form of encoding has been choosen because it enables us to specify floating point numbers whose representation will not depend of machine specificities; the result of the coding procedures will thus be machine independant.

The self coherency tests would not discover the differences between the encoding generated by MAVROS and a correct encoding. In order to detect any discrepancy, the test_mvr program can be ordered to compare the encoding with a reference version, stored in the file test.dump specified by the -diff argument.

The format of this file is the same text encoded ASN1 as that of the reference file test.dump. The file can indeed be produced by editing the text of the reference file. Each element is loaded in memory by using the asn1_load routine of the ASN1 library, and is then decoded. The value is compared to the reference value, and any error is reported. The test program will exit with a non null status if any error occurs.

One should note that the introduction of different encodings has obliged us to revise the comparison procedure for the REAL elements. Instead of a simple test for equality, one will also consider that two floating point number match if their relative difference is less than 1.E-7.

The decoding routines generated by MAVROS contain sequences to detect the correctness of the input: trusting the remote entity is generally not an adequate policy in an open network. These routines will detect syntax errors, like missing components or components incorrectly encoded. These error detection sequences are tested by loading in memory incorrect encoding of the reference data, from the file test.failures specified by the -lbad argument to test_mvr.

The test routine will check that an error is detected for each of these entries. The test program will exit with a non null status if one of the error remained undetected; the precise result of the detection is found in the output file.

Another interest of the test is to detect the possibility of the program to survive a decoding error. After each decoding, the allocated memory is freed by calling the routine entry_free, and one can check that all memory allocations have been cleared.

The current version of the light weight decoding routines is not very satisfactory. A better version is under design. The test of the light weight routines has thus been placed under conditional compilation, with the flag INRIA, in the test program.

As for the standard encoding, the program will return an error if the decoded value does not match the initial value. By looking at the test output, one can check that all memory affectations have been cleared.

The text coding procedures are tested by applying the procedure entry_out to the initial value, and comparing the result with the content of the file test.text_out, specified by the parameter -dtxt to the program test_mvr. The program test_mvr can be directed to produce a reference text by passing the text file parameter with the -prt argument to test_mvr.

The decoding is tested by loading in memory the text values stored in the file test.text_ref specified with the argument -ltxt, using the procedure asn1_load_text of the ASN1 library, by decoding them with the entry_in procedure, and by comparing the result with the reference value.

If a difference between the reference data and the copied data is detected, the test program will exit with anon null code. The test output can be examined to check that all the memory allocated during the copying is freed by entry_free.

This program will read an input file, oidt.input, which contains the on each line an object identifier description, preceded by the letter d if that object shall be declared, or by the letter p if it should only be printed.

On each line, an UTC time value, or a generalized time value, is separated by a / from the print out of the same date in the UNIX format, for a machine running a local time of GMT+1. The program will decode the UTC time value and compare the result to UNIX date; it will return an error in case of a difference. Then, it will reencode the date, and check that the result of the encoding is equal to the original value.

The MAVROS compiler itself is portable, and does not make assumptions on either the CPU or the particular brand of UNIX which is in use on the target machine. Moreover, it generates portable code; the system dependancies are concentrated in the ASN1 run time library, which will have to be ported on every target system. In fact, MAVROS makes only one hypothesis: that the machine is byte oriented, that one can address individual bytes. Porting to a non byte oriented architecture, e.g. where a single character is stored on a 64 bits word or where the word size is 36 bits, would be difficult.

ANYBOUNDARY is set to indicate that on the target machine the long integers can be stored on arbitrary locations. This flag should not be set if the target machine, like the SPARC, requires that long integers start on word boundaries.

BIGENDIAN is set if the machine stores the bits of an integer word in big endian format, i.e. most significant bit first. It should not be set on machines like vaxen, which use the opposite little endian convention.

This page is intended for people who have either a reception or an emission card and participate to these experiments. If you want to get connected to our satellite network and participate to our experiments you can contact Walid Dabbous from INRIA.

At the sending side, an IP packet is encapsulated in a lower level format called Multiprotocol Encapsulation (MPE), it is similar to the Ethernet data link. This MPE packet is segmented at driver level in 184 byte segment long. Each of these segments is encapsulated behind an MPEG 2 4 byte header long, an MPEG 2 transport stream is then composed of a succession of 188 byte packets (header+MPE segment). As the reception card receives the incoming stream, it reassembles the MPE packet according to information found in the headers. The driver reads the packet from the card and delivers the decapsulted IP datagram to the network layers.

We provide several packages which are required to get connected to the satellite network: the card driver, the MPE source code and the link layer tunneling mechanism (lltm) (see UniDirectional Link working group at IETF).

This is not as trivial as installing a receiver, you first need to set up an up-link station, get satellite capacity from Eutelsat and an authorization to transmit with your national competent authority (e.g. in France contact the ART). You can ask Nghia Pham from Eutelsat to obtain all the necessary information about the type of equipment you need.

The feed (pacman) is located INRIA Sophia Antipolis near Nice in the south of France. pacman is a FreeBSD router connected to the INRIA local network (Ethernet card) and to the satellite network (DVB/MPEG II card). It fowards unicast as well as multicast traffic from the INRIA network to the satellite network. In both cases (unicast and multicast), it can run common routing daemons in order to exchange routing information with receivers to perform dynamic routing. However, the feed and the receivers are directly connected with an undirectional link (broadcast satellite network) which causes routing protocols to misbehave. In order to allow routing protocols to run over this topolgy, the feed supports the implementation of the link layer tunneling mechanism. Basically, this mechanism hides to IP level the unidirectional feature of the link emulating a bidirectional connectivity.

The first experimentation was to interconnect INRIA and UCL local networks via the satellite link. We used the "rendez-vous" videoconferencing tool between INRIA and UCL with a point to point communication. Routing was statically modified in order to forward the IP traffic from INRIA to UCL via the satellite network. The available bandwidth was of 3 Mbps offering a zero percent loss rate. We reached a 20 f/s video frame rate and the audio was coded at a 44 khz sample rate without dropping a single packet.

Once the topology was operational, professors on both sides of the mediterranean sea performed a tele-medicine demonstration with exchange of documents (X-rays, images, etc.) and communicated via videoconference applications.

Beginning of September 97, the first implementation of the link layer tunneling mechanism was released. From then on, this allowed routing protocols to be properly supported by feeds and receivers. The receiver operating systems were enhanced to handle this tunneling mechanism.

At this time we had receivers located in London (England), Darmstadt (Germany) and Eutelsat (Paris). These receivers and the feed ran the mrouted multicast routing daemon without configuring multicast tunnels (we used here the multicast capability of the satellite link). The receivers were also connected to the rest of MBone and then forwarded the multicast traffic to Northern Europe with a null loss rate. The aim of this experimentation was to integrate a broadcast satellite network in the MBone and to show that it suits particularly well to multicast transmission.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

This document describes a mechanism to emulate bidirectional connectivity between nodes that are directly connected by a unidirectional link. The "receiver" uses a link layer tunneling mechanism to forward datagrams to "feeds" over a separate bidirectional IP network. As it is implemented at the link layer, protocols in addition to IP may also be supported by this mechanism.

This document describes a link layer tunneling mechanism that allows nodes which are directly connected by a unidirectional link (feeds and receivers, see Section 2 for terminology) to send datagrams as if they were connected to a bidirectional link. We present a generic topology with a tunneling mechanism that supports multiple feeds and receivers.

The tunneling mechanism is implemented at the link layer of the interface of every node connected to the unidirectional link. The aim is to hide from higher layers, i.e. the network layer and above, the unidirectional nature of the link. The tunneling mechanism also includes an automatic tunnel configuration protocol that allows nodes to come up/down at any time.

Feeds and receivers are connected via a unidirectional link. Send- only feeds can only send data over this unidirectional link, and receivers can only receive data from it. Receive capable feeds have both send and receive capabilities.

This mechanism has been designed to work with any topology with any number of receivers and one or more feeds. However, it is expected that the number of feeds will be small. In particular, the special case of a single send-only feed and multiple receivers is among the topologies supported.

A feed has several interfaces, a send-only or a send-and-receive capable interface connected to the unidirectional link and one or more additional bidirectional communication interfaces. A feed MUST be a router.

Tunnels are constructed between the bidirectional interfaces of nodes, so these interfaces must be interconnected by an IP infrastructure. In this document we assume that that infrastructure is the Internet.

Note that nodes have IP addresses on their unidirectional and their bidirectional interfaces. The addresses on the unidirectional interfaces (f1u, f2u, r1u, r2u) will be drawn from the same IP network. In general the addresses on the bidirectional interfaces (f1b, f2b, r1b, r2b) will be drawn from different IP networks, and the Internet will route between them.

However, if Recv 1 initiates a 'ping f1u', it cannot get a response from Feed 1. The network layer of Recv 1 delivers the packet to the driver of the receive-only interface, which obviously cannot send it to the feed.

The simplest solution is to emulate a broadcast capable link layer network. This will allow the immediate deployment of existing higher level protocols without change. Though other network structures, such as NBMA, could also be emulated, a broadcast network is more generally useful. Though a layer 3 network could be emulated, a link layer network allows the immediate use of any other network layer protocols, and most particularly allows the immediate use of ARP.

A link layer (LL) tunneling mechanism which emulates bidirectional connectivity in the presence of a unidirectional link will be described in the next Section. We first consider the various communication scenarios which characterize a broadcast network in order to define what functionalities the link layer tunneling mechanism has to perform in order to emulate a bidirectional broadcast link.

These scenarios are possible on a broadcast network. Scenario 6 is already feasible on the unidirectional link. The link layer tunneling mechanism should therefore provide the functionality to support scenarios 1 to 5.

Note that regular IP forwarding over such an emulated network (i.e. using the emulated network as a transit network) works correctly; the next hop address at the receiver will be the unidirectional link address of another router (a feed or a receiver) which will then relay the packet.

On the receiver, a datagram is delivered to the link layer of the unidirectional interface for transmission (see Figure 2). It is then encapsulated behind a MAC header corresponding to the unidirectional link. This packet cannot be sent directly over the link, so it is then processed by the tunneling mechanism.

The packet is encapsulated behind an IP header whose destination is the IP address of a feed bidirectional interface (f1b or f2b). This destination address is also called the tunnel end-point.  The mechanism for a receiver to learn these addresses and to choose the feed is explained in Section 7. The type of encapsulation is described in Section 8.

The encapsulated datagram is passed to the network layer which forwards it according to its destination address. The destination address is a feed bidirectional interface which is reachable via the Internet. In this case, the encapsulated datagram is forwarded via the receiver bidirectional interface (r1b).

A feed cannot directly send a packet to a send-only feed over the unidirectional link (Scenario 4).  In order to emulate this type of communication, feeds have to tunnel packets to send-only feeds. A feed MUST maintain a list of all other feed tunnel end-points. This list MUST indicate which are send-only feed tunnel end-points. This is configured manually at the feed by the local administrator, as described in Section 7.

Caution: a receiver which sends an encapsulated broadcast/multicast packet to a default feed will receive its own packet via the unidirectional link. Correct filtering as described in [rfc1112] must be applied.

The number of feeds is expected to be relatively small (Section 3), so at every feed the list of all feeds is configured manually. This list should note which are send-only feeds, and which are receive capable feeds. The administrator sets up tunnels to all send-only feeds. A tunnel end-point is an IP address of a bidirectional link on a send-only feed.

When the unidirectional link is down, receivers must disable their tunnels. The tunneling mechanism emulates bidirectional connectivity between nodes. Therefore, if the unidirectional link is down, a feed should not receive datagrams from the receivers. Protocols that consider a link as operational if they receive datagrams from it (e.g. the RIP protocol [rfc2453]) require this behavior for correct operation.

When a feed is down, receivers must disable their corresponding tunnel. This prevents unnecessary datagrams from being tunneled which might overload the Internet. For instance, there is no need for receivers to forward a broadcast message through a tunnel whose end-point is down.

The DTCP protocol provides a means for receivers to dynamically discover the presence of feeds and to maintain a list of operational tunnel end-points. Feeds periodically announce their tunnel end-point addresses over the unidirectional link. Receivers listen to these announcements and maintain a list of tunnel end-points.

The process checks if there is an entry for FUIP in the list of active feeds. If there is, the timer is disabled and the entry is deleted from the list. The LEAVE message provides a means of quickly updating the list of active feeds.

In either case, bidirectional connectivity can no longer be ensured between the receiver and the feed (FUIP): either the feed is no longer routing datagrams over the unidirectional link, or the link is down. Thus the associated entry is removed from the list of active feeds, whatever the cause. As a result, the list only contains operational tunnel end-points.

The choice of the default feed is made independently at each receiver. The choice is a matter of local policy, and this policy is out of scope for this document. However, as an example, the default feed may be the feed that has the lowest round trip time to the receiver.

The tunneling mechanism operates at the link layer and emulates bidirectional connectivity amongst receivers and feeds. We assume that hardware connected to the unidirectional link supports broadcast and unicast MAC addressing. That is, a feed can send a packet to a particular receiver using a unicast MAC destination address or to a set of receivers using a broadcast/multicast destination address. The hardware (or the driver) of the receiver can then filter the incoming packets sent over the unidirectional links without any assumption about the encapsulated data type.

In a similar way, a receiver should be capable of sending unicast and broadcast MAC packets via its tunnels.  Link layer packets are encapsulated.  As a result, after decapsulating an incoming packet, the feed can perform link layer filtering as if the data came directly from the unidirectional link (See Figure 2).

An alternative is to encapsulate the MAC level packet within IP. The protocol field in the IP datagram is then set to the MAC type of the unidirectional link. Figure 5 presents the entire encapsulated packet.

Regardless of whether the link is unidirectional or bidirectional, if a feed sends a packet over a non-point-to-point type network, it requires the data link address of the destination. ARP [rfc826] is used on Ethernet networks for this purpose.

Because of long round trip delays, reactive address resolution methods such as ARP [rfc826] may not work well. For example, a feed may have to forward packets at high data rates to a receiver whose hardware address is unknown. The stream of packets is passed to the link layer driver of the feed send-only interface. When the first packet arrives, the link layer realizes it does not have the corresponding hardware address of the next hop, and sends an ARP request. While the link layer is waiting for the response (at least 250 ms for the GEO satellite case), IP packets are buffered by the feed. If it runs out of space before the ARP response arrives, IP packets will be dropped.

This problem of address resolution protocols is not addressed in this document. An ad-hoc solution is possible when the MAC address is configurable, which is possible in some satellite receiver cards. A simple transformation (maybe null) of the IP address can then be used as the MAC address. In this case, senders do not need to "resolve" an IP address to a MAC address, they just need to perform the simple transformation.

The link layer tunneling mechanism hides from the network and higher layers the fact that feeds and receivers are connected by a unidirectional link. Communication is bidirectional, but asymmetric in bandwidths and delays.

These protocols will work fine because the tunneling mechanism results in bidirectional connectivity between all feeds and receivers. Thus routing messages can be exchanged as on any bidirectional network.

Receivers can route datagrams on the Internet using the most suitable feed or receiver as a next hop. Administrators may want to set the metrics used by their routing protocols in order to reflect in routing tables the asymmetric characteristics of the link, and thus direct traffic over appropriate paths.

The DTCP protocol does not generate a lot of traffic whatever the number of nodes. The problem with a large number of nodes is not related to this protocol but to more general issues such as the maximum number of nodes which can be connected to any link. This is out of scope of this document.

Security in a network using the link layer tunneling mechanism should be relatively similar to security in a normal IPv4 network. However, as the link layer tunneling mechanism uses GRE[rfc2784], it is expected that GRE authentication mechanism combined with a specific link layer security mechanism on the back-channel will help to enhance security in a unidirectional link environment.

In order to prevent unauthorised users from providing fake routing information, routing protocols running on top of the link layer tunneling mechanism MUST use authentication mechanisms when available.

DoCM researcher Martyn Amos has emerged as a prominent figure in this new science after being the first person to complete a PhD in the field. And on November 15 his book Genesis Machines: The New Science of Biocomputation will bethe first popular science book published on the subject.

A US experiment had suggested that DNA could be tailored to produce sequences representing every possible answer to a given problem. Amos took that a stage further developed a new technique to strip away swathes of "wrong answer" molecules until the "correct answer" was isolated.

Dr Amos, of MMU's Dalton Research Institute said: "DNA and the cellular machinery that operates it is the original reprogrammable computer, predating man-made efforts by billions of years. It can generate signals, make decisions, switch things on and off like a program that controls its own execution.

"Tapping into biology is immensely powerful because Nature has data storage and processing down to a fine art: every living cell of the human body contains enough data to fill 200 copies of the Manhattan telephone directory!"

Applications include medical diagnostics and drug delivery where traditional silicon machines are too large, invasive or prone to error. One idea is to create a "doctor in a cell" - a reprogrammed human cell that could roam the body sniffing out and destroying disease.

Applications are invited for the above post which is to work within the Centre for Mathematical Modelling and Flow Analysis based in the department.The project is to develop a CFD Numerical Wave Tank model of wave interactions with floating bodies.  You should possess a first degree and/or Masters? and PhD in mathematics, engineering, or a closely related subject discipline with recent postdoctoral and/or industrial research experience directly relevant to the project.

The current Combined Honours degree course has been operating at Manchester Metropolitan University in various forms since 1969. From the outset, mathematics has played an important role and this was one of the original subject options along with Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

Applicable Mathematics is the set of mathematical techniques and methods that can be applied to describing the world in which we live. The areas covered include: numerical methods (which is the use of computers to solve equations), computational modelling of fluid flows (which deals with the calculation of gas and liquid flows around objects and has applications to aircraft/spacecraft designs, wind energy and the modelling of rivers and estuaries), modelling of digital communications systems (which involves the coding of data for easy transmission and the study of transmission protocols), computer graphics (the realistic rendering of three-dimensional objects on a computer), mathematical modelling (the use of mathematics to describe real world systems and problems), high performance computer systems and digital sound and image processing. As can be seen from these topics, the usefulness of mathematics is continually stressed throughout the course.

Stage 1 of Business Mathematics is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of Operational Research and Statistics, to develop your mathematical skills, and to provide you with a basic competence in computer programming, information technology and study skills. The purpose of this is to introduce you to the rational analysis of decisions and to provide the basic skills that you will build on in stage 2.

Operational Research is the use of rational, scientific and numerate methods to solve decision problems. The characteristic approach of Operational Research is to use a mathematical model of the situation under investigation. The model will predict the behaviour of the system in which the problem occurs and will allow a mathematical search of the available policies to decide which is the best one to adopt.

Linear Models - Models where the response of the system is proportional to the various decisions made. These models are handled by linear programming, a technique which uses simple arithmetic operations to find the optimum of a linear function subject to linear constraints. Linear programming forms a large part of this unit and both the formulation of problems as Linear Programmes and the solution of Linear Programmes is covered.

Spreadsheet models - These models are written on a spreadsheet which is used to evaluate the consequences of given decisions and for simple problems is used to search for the best available decisions.

Non-Linear Models - Models where the response of the system is a non-linear function of the decisions made. These models are handled by a variety of numerical techniques. Only the very simplest of these techniqes is covered in this unit, but even this technique is sufficient to solve many practical problems.

Project Planning - Models which are used to plan projects involving many different interacting tasks. This topic provides the opportunity to use some of the techniques taught in the unit on practical problems.

In order to investigate the behaviour of a business it is necessary to collect samples of data from it and to use these to draw conclusions about the operation of the system under investigation. This requires an understanding of the standard methods and concepts of statistics.

Supporting Mathematics - This unit is designed to keep you in practice in conventional mathematics. Business Maths students usually perform very well on this unit which helps to support further mathematics later in the course. Students reading Appicable Mathematics as their other subjects do not need to take this unit.

Business Mathematics is studied with another subject in stages one and two of the course. In the first year you will take this on an equal level with Business Mathematics and if you wish you may make the other subject your main study later on in the course. Later in the course you may reduce the amount of your other subject taken and if you wish you may specialise entirely in Business Mathematics in your final year.

Stage 2 of the course develops your skills in Business Analysis to the point where you will be able to apply them to problems in the real world. All the most useful basic tools are developed to a useful level, as is the general background you will use in analysing business problems.

Simulation - This involves writing computer programs which behave in the same way as the system that you are studying. The university has a specialised simulation package available which allows you to generate these simulations easily and will let you gain experience of developing realistic simulations and using these to draw conclusions on the operation of lifelike systems.

Markov Chains and Queueing Theory - These models allow you to predict the behaviour of systems where there is a large random element. The best example of such systems are queues. These are present in almost every business operation and queueing theory will allow one to predict the behaviour of such queues from simple back of the envelope calculations.

Further Linear Programming - Linear programming models can be used to gain a great deal of information about the performance of a system. In stage 2 you will develop your understanding of linear models to the point where you can extract all useful information from a linear model.

Linear Models- A linear model is one in which the response of a system can be plotted as a straight line graph. This unit looks at the problems of fitting such models and using them to predict the behaviour of business systems.

Business Mathematics investigation. Such models are used to predict the results of any proposed course of action and the policy with the best outcome can then be adopted. This unit covers some of the basic ideas of Mathematical Modelling and gives you the opportunity to develop your own mathematical models of business systems.

The unit starts with simple models which illustrate some of the principles and pitfalls of mathematical modelling and works up to larger and more realistic models. You will learn to work in groups, to make the best use of data and to present your results in a professional manner.

The technical units of Operational Research, Statistics and Mathematical Modelling teach the basic techniques of analysing business problems. This unit teaches the business background of these problems.

The unit looks at the structure of businesses, the financial background to business, costing and the structuring of problems for solution. It looks closely at the evaluation of investments and the collection and interpretation of data for decision making in business.

Stage 3 of Business Mathematics takes the basic principles that you learned in stage 2 and either applies them to practical situations or extends them further. In this stage you may decide to take a large number of different programmes, dividing your studies between Business Mathematics and your other subject.

You will also carry out a project and will be able to choose from a range of permissible elective units from Health Service Management to Risk Assessment. Students can study a language for three years alongside Business Mathematics and this would lead to a full unit in the final year.

All students complete a project in their final year. This is a substantial piece of work which is carried out alone, with the help of an academic supervisor. Past students have carried out projects in conjunction with various commercial firms from a steel manufacturer to a lottery.

Business Mathematics is the use of logical and quantitative reasoning to make rational decisions, usually in the context of business although the methods of Business Mathematics can be applied to services, government, commerce, industry, military and almost any other situation where significant decisions need to be made.

The main idea behind Business Mathematics is that of the mathematical model. This is a description of the system under investigation which allows predictions to be made of the system's behaviour. Usually the model used will be a system of equations which describes the various factors in the system behaviour, but a model could be a computer program which behaves in the same manner as the system under investigation (a simulation model) or a set of logical statements about the system (a formal model). It is important to produce a model which is sufficiently detailed to cover all the main points of system behaviour but not too detailed to be easily manipulated.

Once a mathematical model has been produced the policy options available to the managers of the system are searched to discover what policy produces the best outcome. This will be presented for possible implementation.

Techniques: Most of the mathematical models used in Business cannot be handled by conventional calculus methods. A specialised group of mathematical techniques has thus been developed to handle the models that may occur in an investigation. These techniques are different from those studied in conventional mathematics but are certainly no more difficult to learn or use. These techniques are usually found in textbooks on Operational Research.

Statistics: In order to understand a system well enough to make a decision, it is important to be able to form estimates of the various quantities which describe the performance of the system. As all that is usually available is a sample of observations of the system a knowledge of statistics is important to process these observations so that meaningful conclusions can be drawn.

Methodology: This is the practice of starting an investigation, from the moment when it is decided to go ahead with one through the process of building models and making policy decisions through to the process of monitoring the new policies to determine whether they are still effective.If you have a good understanding of mathematical reasoning and you are looking for a career in business or business analysis and you are ready to enter higher education Then Business Mathematics is for you.

Business Mathematics runs within the Combined Honours Scheme at MMU which means that it must be studied with another subject. You may continue to take both subjects in all three years in which case, on successful completion of the course, you will be awarded an honours degree with a joint title.

Running Business Mathematics within the Combined Honours scheme gives you the advantage of flexibility. You can join either version of the course, swap between them and vary your programme between your two subjects in almost any proportions. You only need to decide what to study in your next year's programme towards the end of the previous year (subject to having studied suitable earlier units and availability of units).

The Computer Studies principal subject includes a Programming unit on which all students study Java, a structured programming language. The Computer Studies principal subject extends the emphasis on programming. Computer Platforms is a unit that teaches you about computing machines and how programs are actually executed. Information Systems students study Data Analysis and Database Design alongside the Information Systems for Organisations unit and these two units together introduce the role of computers in the business world and, through practical work, teach how an information system may be designed in a realistic situation.

Computer Studies students continue to study programming, and extend their knowledge of computer systems within Computer Networks and can include End User Support and Multimedia Development. Information Systems students at Stage Two study units in Information Systems Development and Database Development, thus deepening knowledge acquired at Stage One. Multimedia Development, Electronic Business and Finance and Operations may also be studied.

Topics studied at Stage Two can be looked at in more depth, or you can choose to study units dealing with topics where there is current research activity, taught by staff who are active in this research. Computer Studies students take Web and Internet Based Development and Network Administration, Management and Security and might include Artificial Intelligence Techniques, Professional Environment and/or Human Computer Interaction. Information Systems students take Information Systems Management and Professional Environment and may also opt for units in Human Computer Interaction, Advanced Database Applications and Decision Analysis.

Computer Studies and Information Systems within the Combined Honours Scheme are the responsibility of the Department of Computing and Mathematics.  The Department has over 60 academic staff, with support from administrative and technical staff.  Many academics are active in research, with Computer-Aided Learning, Formal Logics, Electronic Data Interchange, Multimedia Systems and Neural Networks being just some of the areas in which staff are working.  All computing teaching and laboratory work takes place in the John Dalton site, at the University's main All Saints campus close to central Manchester.

Facilities within the Department are being up-dated all the time, in keeping with the demands of an industry characterised by rapid change.  Currently, we offer a variety of platforms for student use, on Pentium based PCs.  Our laboratories are equipped with an impressive array of software on networks and stand-alone machines, amongst which are authoring and systems design tools.

The wide range of principal subjects which can be taken with either subject is listed, with the appropriate UCAS codes, in the tables shown by clicking the Combined Honours Scheme link in the Special Features section.  Computer Studies may be combined with Information Systems leading to a single computing award containing both titles.  However should you wish to gain an award title BSc (Hons) Computer Studies or BSc (Hons) Information Systems, this can be achieved by taking CS or IS as a major study at Stage Two and following this with an all-CS or all-IS final year.

Most units of study will have two formal assignments, which will contribute to your final grade for the unit, and an end-of-year exam.  Academic progress and attendance are monitored.  The monitoring of attendance may seem a little too like school; in fact it is a condition of accepting fees from Local Education Authorities.  However, there is more to it than that!  We have found over the years that people who attend computing classes regularly do much better, on the whole, than people who don't.  Unlike some disciplines, which involve a lot of reading and can be done in your own time, computing, especially programming, is a skill-based subject.  To acquire skills, it is necessary to practise, and then receive feedback on how you are doing.

There is no need for you to have any computing qualifications, although this would obviously help you.  If you have not studied computing before, you may be wondering if you will like it or be good at it.  People who are good at mathematics or hard sciences will generally have no difficulty with computing; nor will those who enjoy tackling problems by breaking them down into smaller tasks.  It is hard to say what exactly is involved in any skill, but computing is primarily about finding structured solutions to problems.  Creativity may not be something you associate with the study of computing, but this is certainly a quality needed for success in this subject, and the ability to think about several things at once is also said to be useful.  Despite the fact that more men than women study computing at this university and nationwide, there is ample evidence to show that women and men are equally good at computing, and the Department is particularly keen to encourage applications from women.

Synchronization is known to play a vital role within many highly connected neural systems such as the olfactory systems of fish and insects. We show how one can robustly and effectively perform practical computations using small perturbations to a very simple globally coupled network of coupled oscillators. Computations are performed by exploiting the spatio-temporal dynamics of a robust attracting heteroclinic network (also referred to as `winnerless competition' dynamics). We use different cluster synchronization states to encode memory states and use this to design a simple multi-base counter. The simulations indicate that this gives a robust computational system exploiting the natural dynamics of the system.

Usually the model used will be a system of equations which describes the various factors in the system behaviour, but a model could be a computer program which behaves in the same manner as the system under investigation (a simulation model) or a set of logical statements about the system (a formal model). It is important to produce a model which is sufficiently detailed to cover all the main points of system behaviour but not too detailed to be easily manipulated.

Most of the mathematical models used in Business cannot be handled by conventional calculus methods. A specialised group of mathematical techniques has thus been developed to handle the models that may occur in an investigation. These techniques are different from those studied in conventional mathematics but are certainly no more difficult to learn or use. These techniques are usually found in textbooks on Operational Research.

In order to understand a system well enough to make a decision, it is important to be able to form estimates of the various quantities which describe the performance of the system. As all that is usually available is a sample of observations of the system a knowledge of statistics is important to process these observations so that meaningful conclusions can be drawn.

This is the practice of starting an investigation, from the moment when it is decided to go ahead with one through the process of building models and making policy decisions through to the process of monitoring the new policies to determine whether they are still effective.

If you have a good understanding of mathematical reasoning and you are looking for a career in business or business analysis and you are ready to enter higher education Then Business Mathematics is for you.

The Intelligent Systems Group was founded in 1991 by Zuhair Bandar and James O'Shea in the former Department of Computing at MMU. They have been involved, in various capacities, in AI Research and the computer industry for the last 20 years. The group has grown rapidly establishing a core of  high quality academic members. It has also formed links with external academics and industrialists inside and outside of the UK.

The group has established an international position on the strength of its research in the areas of Artificial Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic and Conversational Agents. This has laid the groundwork for the formation of two research centres, namely the Conversational Agent Research Centre and the Adaptive Psychological Profiling Research Centre. A common goal of these two centres is to transfer the benefits of the research to industry.

Almost as many attempts have been made to define Artificial Intelligence (A.I), as have been made to create a system which exhibits qualities regarded as being synonymous with intelligence. The Problem lies in our inability to define Intelligence.

This centre's mission is to perform advanced research in the field of Conversational Agents, to co-operate with international researchers in the field and develop commercial applications in collaboration with industry.

Decision tree rule induction is a method which aims to construct a set of rules which will classify objects from knowledge of a training set of examples whose classes are previously know. The process of classification can be simply defined as the task of discovering  rules or patterns from  a set of data. The objectives of any classification task is to at least equal and essentially exceed a human decision maker in a consistent and practical manner.  The success of any classification algorithm can be measured in terms of accuracy which is determined by  it's performance on an unseen set of data (test set) and it's speed, the time taken to learn  a set of rules or discover patterns from a training set of data. Providing the training set is randomly sampled from the given data set, the accuracy of the test set can be seen to be an un-biased estimate of  performance.

The method is based on recursive partitioning of the sample space and defines classes structurally by using decision trees.  The task of constructing a tree from a training set is known as tree induction. A number of algorithms exist such as ID3,  C4.5, C5,  CHAID and CART which use general to specific learning in order  to build simple knowledge based systems by inducing decision trees from a set of examples.

The concept of fuzzy sets was first outlined in Zadeh's pioneering paper [1]. Zadeh argued that probability was an insufficient  form of   representation for uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence. It lacked the ability to model human conceptualisations of the real world.  The fuzzy logic approach  introduced robustness into  systems by allowing a certain amount of imprecision to exist.  It paved a way for representing human linguistic terms as fuzzy sets, hedges, predicates and quantifiers. Fuzzy Logic has since played an important role in the management of uncertainty, especially in the current major application areas of Expert Systems and other rule based models. During the last three decades the practical results of fuzzy systems have led to a general acceptance within the AI community [2][3].

To determine whether fuzzy logic is applicable to a problem is to say whether an approximate solution is acceptable. Although input may be crisp, the approximation of the outcome is dependent upon the accuracy of the rule set, the inference technique and the membership function. Fuzzy applications are usually those which require alot of human expertise, judgement and intuition and /or are difficult to automate using existing techniques. The wide number of successful applications of fuzzy theory to real world problems has established the field as an important asset in the design and control of a variety of systems [4][5].

This centre's mission is to pioneer a new research area which applies AI Paradigms in the field of Psychological Profiling, disseminate novel themes to other centres of excellence in the fields of Psychological profiling and AI and transfer Intellectual Property to Industry.

The study of massively parallel network of simple processors that have a natural tendency for storing experiential knowledge. Knowledge is acquired through training rather than programming and is stored in the connection strengths. A neural network consists of many simple processors which work together to solve a particular problem.

Zuhair Bandar has been involved with AI research since 1975 in various capacities. After obtaining his Ph.D. from Brunel University he spent a period in industry where he led several research groups developing bilingual software and hardware platforms to support it. After joining MMU he continued with his interest in AI research which led to the establishment of the Intelligent Systems Group in 1991. The original focus of this research group was the areas of Neural Networks, Machine Learning and Fuzzy Logic. In the intervening years the group has grown becoming vibrant and strong with a solid track record in terms of publications and industrial collaboration.

Zuhair Bandar has supervised Ph.D.s to completion, been invited to chair streams and organize themes in international conferences. He is often asked to act as a peer reviewer for journals and international conferences. His current interests include Artificial Neural Networks and its application to real world domains, fuzzy decision trees and Conversational Agents.

Hydroinformatics tools and flow models are increasingly being used to find the best solution to a particular environmental engineering problem. Therefore, it is imperative that such models are as versatile and accurate as possible so that natural water courses, reservoirs, coastal waters and harbors may be managed effectively.

The differential equations are solved for the time variation of water elevation and flow velocity by finite difference/volume methods at the points of intersection of a rectangular mesh overlaid on the river or estuary geometry. When coupled with appropriate equations for multi-species solute transport, it is possible to model the fate of pollutants, assess water quality and predict sediment movements.

The AMAZON family of flow codes developed for the shallow water equations within the CMMFA utilize Riemann based finite volume upwind schemes similar to those used for shock wave modelling and high-resolution solute transport.

In these methods, the fluxes across cell interfaces are calculated by solving a sequence of Riemann problems in a two step scheme which is second order accurate in both space and time. These techniques are valuable for modelling transcritical flows e.g. dam break flood waves, tidal bore propagation, opening of sluice gates and land slides plunging into lakes or reservoirs.

Two flow codes have been developed; both methods incorporate boundary fitted meshes, with generalized meshing strategies to allow mesh adaptivity in regions of complex flow variability and special treatments to accommodate wetting and drying which inevitably occurs in tidal flows. The first code (AMAZON) uses boundary conforming, multi block meshes. This technique allows multiply connected regions to be meshed efficiently and meshes to be embedded within one another to enhance resolution locally. The second code (AMAZON-CC) uses the Cartesian cut cell method. In this meshing approach, the boundary of the domain is cut out of a background rectangular mesh and a flow solution is obtained by performing flux balances over the sides of each cut cell.

The introduction of quad-tree mesh structures, currently under development, allows the user dynamically to refine and de-refine the mesh in regions of interest and adapt the mesh to transients in the flow physics e.g. providing localized mesh resolution for tracking a sharp plume front associated with pollutant dispersal.

Blast waves generated by accidental gas cloud explosions and resulting fire hazards pose a severe threat to human life and property. After the Piper Alpha incident in 1988, the requirement for more accurate assessment of hazards on-board such facilities was strengthened. In order accurately to predict the time history of a gas cloud detonation, features of widely differing physical and time scales must be resolved. The structure of a detonation wave is typically only a few tenths of a millimetre wide whilst a chemical production facility may be on the scale of hundreds of metres.

A process plant may also contain small scale features such as scaffolding towers, gridded walkways and pipe networks which nevertheless have an appreciable effect on flame propagation rates. Analysis of incidents has shown that the damage caused by gas cloud explosions can be greatly increased by sources of partial confinement.

Accurate mathematical modelling of these complex physical phenomena requires the solution of the compressible gas dynamics equations, linked to an appropriate chemical combustion model which accounts for all the important reactions.

Although there exist a number of commercial CFD packages capable of dealing with certain classes of chemically reacting compressible flows, they are mostly intended for dealing with engineering flows and burner designs, and would not normally be suitable for calculations involving complex shock/detonation wave structures which are rapidly evolving through time.

Our code is a three dimensional, multi-species, hydrocode with turbulent mixing and a reduced finite-rate chemical model. Currently, the hydrocode requires the generation of a structured boundary-conforming grid of six-sided cells. However, work is in progress to ensure compatibility with in-house Cartesian cut cell methods in which boundaries are cut out of a Cartesian background grid. This will offer greater geometric flexibility enabling the method to handle arbitrary configurations. The flow solution is advanced from one time step to another through a factored sequence of one dimensional finite volume operators. Each component one dimensional operator itself comprises a factored sequence of operators separately describing the convective and viscous diffusion terms in the equation set and one additional operator is applied at the end of a full sequence to invoke a reduced chemical kinetics model. Since a detailed reaction mechanism for the combustion of simple hydrocarbons usually contains 30-40 chemical species and 100-200 elementary reactions, its use in a flow hydrocode would be prohibitively expensive and unnecessarily detailed. In contrast, one step and two step reaction models oversimplify the description of high temperature combustion, where induction timing and dissociation of final products to equilibrium products are important characteristics of the reaction. Phenomenological models can provide a reasonably accurate description in cases where molecular and turbulent diffusion effects can be ignored, However, for the applications envisaged here, this is not the case. Accordingly, a global simulation method has been developed to reduce a detailed mechanism to a scheme containing four to six reaction steps and six to nine reacting species including reactants, final products and equilibrium products. Reduced reaction schemes have been derived for methane, ethane, acetylene, methanol and hydrogen and several more are under development.

The hydrocode has been used to study the structure of detonation waves, the interaction of detonation waves with obstacles and their failure and recovery. In addition, the code has been applied to a number of representative problems including the interaction of a blast wave with an array of storage tanks, an exploding pressure vessel and the development of a detonation wave in a two dimensional representation of a gas compressor module on board an oil platform.

As part of an ongoing research project we are developing simulation software for urban street canyons using the Lattice Boltzmann method. This approach allows important effects such as buoyancy and the transportation of pollutant species to be included into the basic model in a simple and efficient manner. The authors wish to thank Dr He (Laurence Livermore National Laboratory) for his assistance.

The LB method simulates populations instead of particles, and uses Maxwellian equilibrium distributions instead of collision rules (chosen to obtain long-term behavior parallel to that of the NS equations).

Calculations usually involve adjacent nodes only, which means complex fluid-solid boundaries are easier to incorporate than in traditional CFD methods. Localized calculations also make it easier to represent fluid-fluid boundaries as in gaseous tracers, and are better starting point for implementing on parallel computers.

Frisch et al. (1986) is still used for LB simulations, but is awkward to implement since hexagons do not align in the second 2D direction. A newer 9-velocity square lattice element (D2Q9) has the 2D symmetry necessary for mass and momentum conservation, and is more natural to implement. Since the LB equations are subject to numerical instability, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy criterion constrains the choice of space and time increments.

The mesoscopic populations at every node are computed at every iteration using a 2 step process. Streaming populations to downsteam nodes is a perturbation-inducing process, while population redistribution is an equilibrium-restoring process.

A shock wave interaction with a simple object such as a rectangular block or 90 degree corner can produce a surprisingly complex diffraction pattern. When extrapolated to practical geometries, these effects may give rise to localised 'hot spots' due to complicated shock-on-shock interaction and focussing effects. Studies of the interaction of detonation waves with obstacles e.g. sudden area expansions, square or rectangular-shaped ribs are a case in point. Here, one may see a range of detonation phenomena including: transition to detonation, where a flame front accelerates until it becomes supersonic and transition to detonation occurs; failure of a detonation wave which may occur when a detonation wave, diffracting around an obstacle, weakens to the point where it fails and becomes a flame front propagating behind a shock wave; recovery, where a failed detonation wave returns to detonation; shock induced combustion/detonation where a shock wave passing through a combustible mixture raises the temperature sufficiently to initiate combustion. Replicating these phenomena accurately is a challenging but necessary element of any soundly based mathematical model. And any model must first be tested on simple geometries, making careful comparisons with analytical solutions and/or test data.

Usually the patient is immersed in water permitting shock waves to enter the human body without causing skin damage. A short pulse of high voltage across the gap of an electrode produces a spark which induces a shock wave in the water. An ellipsoidal reflector, placed around the electrode, concentrates the shock wave at its second focus. A stone located there is pulverised by repeated applications of shock wave pulses in a single treatment which normally lasts about 1 hour.

Key parameters are peak pressure and exposure rate (number of shots fired per second). These parameters influence the efficiency of the pulverisation process and the tendency for small cavitation bubbles to form around the stone. The bubbles remain stationary in the water for up to half a second and may be struck by following shock pulses depending upon the exposure rate. A shock/bubble interaction results in collapse of the bubble and the formation of a high velocity water jet which may cause localised tissue damage. In order to better understand the processes involved, it is necessary to study the interaction between the shock wave and gas bubble more closely.

We began our work in shock wave modelling over 20 years ago with artificial viscosity-based methods like MacCormack's scheme derived from the Lax Wendroff method. Since then we have progressively improved the modelling through total variation diminishing (TVD) schemes, which we used in the 1980's, to the methods we use today which are Riemann-based upwind schemes. The majority of such schemes use conservative variables and capture shock waves accurately, eliminating the well known Gibbs oscillations usually identified with convection dominated flows. However, when applied to multicomponent flows, these same modern schemes exhibit spurious oscillations of a different type around the material interface. This has led to much recent work in the area; our approach has been to develop new hybrid primitive-conservative variable schemes which can capture sharp fronts accurately in both single and multicomponent flows. Since multicomponent flow problems occur widely, e.g. in multispecies reactive flow calculations and in models of plume dispersal in groundwater or surface water courses, such developments in the basic modelling techniques are a necessary on-going activity to complement applications.

We have a long standing interest in internal and external compressible aerodynamic flows. Flow codes based on modern high resolution Riemann-based upwind schemes have been developed to accurately resolve shock waves, contact surfaces and other flow discontinuities. The inviscid Euler equations or viscous Navier Stokes equations can be solved in two or three dimensions for steady or unsteady flows. A finite volume implementation is used in conjunction with body fitted grids. For viscous flow calculations, either the laminar or Favre-averaged form of the Navier Stokes equations can be qsolved. A k-e turbulence model is currently implemented for turbulent flow calculations.

Numerical predictions of transient flows are important in a number of aerospace applications. The numerical simulation of unsteady flows involving bodies in relative motion is a particularly challenging problem. Examples can be found in many areas including helicopter rotors, store separation from aircraft, a shell emerging from the muzzle of a gun, sabot/projectile separation or a high speed train emerging from a long tunnel. Such highly time dependent flows, involving shock wave boundary layer interactions, shock-on-shock interactions and relative body motion, are very difficult to handle, both experimentally and numerically.

Applications of this type require special mesh generation techniques in order to represent a moving geometry accurately. Two approaches for dealing with unsteady compressible flows involving moving bodies are: structured grid methods based on overlapping grids in which a grid, boundary-fitted to a moving body, moves across a stationary background grid, and unstructured grid approaches with periodic re-meshing to account for moving boundaries.  We are developing an approach based on Cartesian cut cells which does not at any stage involve any movement of a mesh or remeshing process, as the bodies move. Instead, solid bodies are simply 'cut' out of a stationary background Cartesian mesh. When a body moves, its motion across the stationary mesh is effected by updating the cut cell data and by merging cells.

This approach is illustrated for a planar shock wave interaction with a fixed aerofoil placed at an angle of attack. Line contours illustrate the pressure and density evolution with time.  The method is easily extended to deal with moving bodies, illustrated by an axisymmetric projectile leaving the barrel of a gun fitted with a muzzle brake. The purpose of the muzzle break is to reduce recoil forces.

We have also simulated a twin side-by-side engine intake configuration in surge together with pressure profiles at different times. These results were obtained as part of a study of aircraft engine transients.  One of the engines was assumed to be in surge mode, an acute form of engine stall in which a large back pressure occurs as the engine coughs hot fluid back up the intake. This may arise after a bird strike or other severe flow disturbance. The problem was to determine the effect upon the flow in the adjacent engine which was initially running normally. The calculations were able to show that aerodynamic flow distortion at the compressor face of the adjacent engine was not increased sufficiently to induce a complementary surge in the other engine. The findings were confirmed in flight tests on the full scale aircraft.

The final figure shows the results of a turbulent viscous flow calculation for a cone shaped projectile configuration travelling at Mach 8. This calculation is typical of the hypersonic ballistic problems modelled in house. A sophisticated graphical user interface has been developed in order to make grid generation and results visualisation easy to use by design engineers.

Violent wave overtopping occurs when waves break against sea walls throwing water and spray over the top.  Great Britain has hundreds of kilometres of sea walls and a high proportion have roads and railways running along them; the Cumbrian and South Devon coasts are notorious examples.  Violent overtopping events can be extremely dangerous with people, cars and even trains having been washed into the sea!  Waves generated by storms, either locally or offshore, exacerbated by high tides and low air pressure lead to the disruption of road and rail services, flooding, structural damage and occasionally loss of life.

The Centre for Mathematical Modelling and Flow Analysis (CMMFA) at MMU, together with the Universities of Edinburgh and Sheffield, has been funded by the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) to investigate the violent overtopping of sea walls - the total project is worth half a million pounds.  The Universities of Edinburgh and Sheffield are conducting an experimental programme while the CMMFA is developing a mathematical model to simulate overtopping events. The experimental programme is being conducted using both a 20m flume located at Edinburgh University, for two dimensional experiments, and the wave basins at HR-Wallingford for three dimensional experiments.

The Navier-Stokes equations, a coupled system of partial differential equations describing the conservation of mass, momentum and energy in a fluid, can be used to describe wave overtopping events.  These equations cannot be solved analytically, so computational techniques must be used.

Navier-Stokes equations has been used to model water waves but these equations are not valid once the waves break, so a new model must be developed. MMU is developing a new method which will accurately track the water surface, even after the wave breaks. This method will provide a tool which will help engineers to design sea defences and assess coastlines which are at risk from violent overtopping.

The solver is essentially one dimensional so a sequence of operators is used to extend it to two dimensional problems using the ideas of dimensional splitting.  Term splitting is employed to solve for viscous and other source terms using a sequence of implicit operators.  Special care has been taken to account for the effect of bed slope and this term has been incorporated into the advective solver.

Unlike many existing shallow water codes which given inaccurate results or simply crash, Amazon is capable of simulating transcritical flow regimes and can capture complex flow phenomena such as bore waves and hydraulic jumps.

AMAZON is written in finite volume form so that complex geometries, which often occur in practical problems, can be discretised accurately.   This flexible mesh generation capability is coupled with a sophisticated patching algorithm to enable the hydraulic engineer to refine the mesh in areas of interest without compromising the speed of the code unnecessarily.

AMAZON has been extensively validated against a large number of demanding problems which include dam breaks, surge waves in a channel with varying bed slope, oblique hydraulic jumps, jet forced circulation in a basin, tidal circulation in a harbour, tidal bore wave propagation, wave runup and reflection at a sloping beach and wave overtopping at sloping and vertical sea walls.

The development of numerical methods capable of predicting solutions to flow problems with a moving free surface separating two segregated fluids are of fundamental interest in civil and process engineering. Furthermore, there are also certain situations where a strong interaction between two fluids occurs and the movement of both fluids is important for the flow problem and should be accounted for in the solution. For example, there is a need for a numerical methodology for predicting the violent overtopping of waves at sea walls which involves both the overturning of waves and the entrainment of one fluid into the other, as well as fluid-structure interactions. Recent interest in wave powered electrical generation techniques, using oscillating water columns to generate an alternating stream of high velocity air which in turn drives a turbine, also involves the flows of both water and air and their interfaces (Muller and Whittaker 1995). Traditional approaches to flow problems with free surfaces are surface-fitting methods and surface-tracking methods. Surface-fitting methods (Glimm et al.

Free surface capturing method A two-fluid solver has been developed which can be applied to a variety of engineering problems with free surfaces and static/moving bodies based on the surface capturing scheme and a novel Cartesian cut cell approach (Causon et al. 2001; Qian et al 2001) More specifically, the mathematical model of an immiscible two-fluid system is formulated as a set of partial differential equations which govern the motion of an inviscid, incompressible, variable density fluid. These equations consist of a mass conservation (density) equation (which is mathematically equivalent to the volume fraction transport equation), momentum equation and an incompressibility constraint that are solved simultaneously using the finite volume method. The formulation is based on the artificial compressibility method (Chorin 1967; Soh et al. 1988; Rogers 1990; Beddhu et al. 1994; Qian et al 2001) in which the pressure, density and velocity fields are directly coupled to produce a hyperbolic system of equations. To achieve a time-accurate solution for unsteady flow problems an implicit dual-time iteration technique has been used (Soh et al. 1988; Rogers et al. 1990) in which the solution at each real time step is obtained by solving a steady-state problem in a pseudotime domain. To evaluate the inviscid fluxes, Roe's flux function is adopted locally at each cell interface assuming a 1-D Riemann problem in the direction normal to the cell face. To achieve a second-order accurate solution in space, a piecewise linear model for the stored cell centre variables is used in conjunction with a slope limiter to prevent over-shoots or under-shoots of the interpolated data at cell interfaces before the two Riemann states are computed. At the pseudotime iteration level, however, a first order upwind scheme is sufficient to calculate the inviscid fluxes and the resultant linear equations are solved using an approximate LU factorisation scheme (Pan et al. 1988). At every real time step, once the flow variables including density have been calculated, the position of the material interface can be defined as the contour with the average density value of the two fluids. A number of different boundary conditions including inlet, outlet (open boundary) and solid walls are implemented to facilitate the applications to real flow problems. Complex geometries and moving bodies (Causon et al.  2001, Qian et al, 2003) arising in real flow problems can be easily represented by cut cells which provide a fully boundary-fitted mesh capability without any mesh generation in the conventional sense.  Unlike conventional mesh generation procedures, no remeshing is required to accommodate bodies moving through the computational domain. All that is necessary is to recompute local cut cell data along the periphery of the body as it moves across a fixed background Cartesian mesh. This involves updates to a small minority of the total number of mesh cells even in cases that employ mesh adaptation. A novel scheme has also been proposed for the accurate treatment of the pressure gradient term within the free surface capturing method for flows under the influence of gravity (Qian et al 2002). The vertical pressure gradient term is split into hydrostatic and kinematic pressure gradient terms which are then calculated separately in order to exactly balance the gravity source term in each cell.

A number of demanding test cases have been calculated to show the feasibility and potential accuracy of the method. These include the classical low amplitude sloshing problem, the collapse of a water column and the collapse of a water column and subsequent flow over an obstacle. To demonstrate the applicability of the multi-component AMAZON-SC solver for complex geometries with moving bodies, a wedge-like 2-D body in prescribed motion from air into water has also been simulated.

Lattice Boltzman (LB) simulations of lid-driven cavity flow were done by Hou et al. (1995) and Chen et al. (1996) with boundary conditions for completely enclosed domains. While an urban canyon resembles a lid-driven cavity in some respects, accurately simulating the observed circulations requires changes to the simple cavity geometry. Urban canyon circulation patterns often extend above the cavity opening, and are asymmetric in the downwind direction. The 2D modelling domain as used by Oke (1987) has a flow channel between the cavity opening and the possibly permeable moving lid, bounded by an inlet and outlet at opposite ends as shown below. This study explores the suitability of the LB method for simulating atmospheric circulations in realistic 2D urban canyon configurations.

It must be emphasised that the following experiments are configuration studies for a given Reynolds number, rather than simulations using wind tunnel or field measurements. A typical urban canyon with characteristic lengt, L = 10m, characteristic velocity, U = 5m/s, and air kinematic viscosity ,ν = 1.51x10^{-5} m^2/s, will have a Reynolds number of over 3 million. This very high value is difficult to implement with the current LB model and would require 100000 nodes in the x-direction, which is currently impractical in terms of computing time.

To replicate the wind tunnel experiments by Rafailidis (1997), cases with H/W = 1 for upstream and downstream roof pitch angle of 45 inside and outside the cavity are simulated. The streamline contours for symmetric 45 roofs bend down in a forward-tilted W-shape at roof level, and stay roughly level above. The main difference in contour patterns between roofs inside and outside the cavity is the depth of the asymmetric clockwise main vortex and core location, where the apparent cavity depth is less for roofs inside the cavity and more for roofs outside the cavity.

For the square cavity with 45° sloped roofs on both sides, the k-ε CFD model of Theodoridis and Moussiopoulos (2000) simulated a clockwise vortex at roof level and a counterclockwise vortex below. The wind tunnel data they used suggest that tracer concentrations inside the flat and sloped roof cavities differed only in spatial distribution, not in total amount. It is unclear whether this was an effect of the double vortex flow field they simulated. This is very different from the single clockwise vortex in the whole cavity simulated by the LB method. A possible explanation would be the CFD study simulates several upstream obstacles and shows a distinct upward velocity component at the upstream roof peak, while the LB study assumes the surfaces before and after the cavity are flat resulting in no vertical velocity at the upstream roof peak.

The streamline contours for symmetric 15 roofs also bend down in a flat U-shape at roof level and stay roughly level above. Similarly, the main difference in contour patterns between roofs inside and outside the cavity is the depth of the symmetric clockwise main vortex.

With the upstream roof peak inside the cavity, streamline contours slope up in a back-tilted U-shape at roof level and are roughly straight at higher levels resembling those for the symmetric canyon, but with an asymmetric back-tilted clockwise main vortex. There was unusual numerical instability when the upstream roof peak was outside the cavity, but streamline contours at 16384 time steps slope down at roof level and immediately above, but are roughly straight higher up. The asymmetric clockwise main vortex is somewhat deeper than the cavity.

Industry, local authorities and the regulatory bodies all face problems when applications are raised to develop land in the vicinity of hazardous installations. Explosion hazard assessment methodologies play an important role in making decisions.

These range between the simple conservative methodologies, presently used by the regulatory bodies, to the expensive risk assessments conducted by safety consultants. These decision methodologies have large financial implications since advice against development results in sterile land. The over-conservative placement of consultation zones can force all parties into time consuming and expensive safety assessments. The basic methods used to assess blast hazard, however, are nearly 50 years old. Their simplicity derives from their inclusion of blast structure interaction in an umbrella fashion. This only distinguishes between scenarios on the basis of the size of the explosion inventory and does not take account of the layout and sizes of structures in the intervening region between explosion source and the proposed site. This explosion methodology contrasts to that used for gas dispersion in which the effects of buildings are handled with confidence and which act to aid gas dispersion and, thereby, reduce hazard distances.

There are good physical reasons why the beneficial effects of the blast sheltering have not found their place in current hazard methodology. This is because the incident peak overpressure is the primary factor used to assess fatality probability. This recognises that shock wave reflection is primarily responsible for direct injury and indirectly through structural failure and projectiles.

The peak shock overpressure, however, is the highest frequency component of the blast wave and which, therefore, is the most affected by diffraction and reflection. This also makes the interaction effects very sensitive to the details of the obstacle layout and obstacle sizes relative to the blast wavelength. Furthermore the peak overpressure must be determined to well within 10% or else the fatality probability will be misjudged. A 50% underestimate can make a very big difference to the positions of the consultation zone boundaries.

Present day shock capturing methods provide a method, albeit at large expense, to study specific scenarios. While these may be used in a Safety Case their value is diminished by the contrasting predictions offered by the very conservative methodologies used by the regulatory authorities as well as the lack of experimental validation on practical scenarios needed for engineering design confidence.

Thus there would be a large impact all round if present day blast CFD methods could be combined with work-station-scale processing to provide predictions of detailed scenarios with the accuracy necessary for engineering decisions. An increasing recognition of this general problem has prompted he HSE to sponsor a limited research programme to assess the state-of-the-art CFD blast prediction methods for studying blast interaction effects. This concluded that there is a lot of scope for exploiting conservatism in present methods but practical studies are only presently possible on simple geometries that can be idealised as axi-symmetric. Even the simplest 3D problems result in prohibitively sized calculations when the appropriate grid size is chosen to achieve sufficient accuracy in shock capture.

The study also included field-scale experimental work, which was compromised both by the size of the experimental team required to service the work and the small number of measurement positions and obstacle layouts that could be practically accommodated. The CFD simulation studies, therefore, had the additional benefit of enabling the whole pressure field to be searched so as to identify the worst-case pressures irrespective of whether they occurred on the ground. The experimental accuracy was also compromised at the field-scale by limiting the range of charge weights that could be used. Small charge weights could not be used due to boundary layer losses nor could large charge weights due to the corrupting effects of ground shock.

After validating the Prometheus blastwave code against the experimental results obtained by the HSL a series of parametric studies were undertaken.  The effects of these parameters including charge weight, distance from charge, building height, number of buildings and distance of observer from the nearest building were examined and a series of sheltering curves proposed.  It is hoped that these curves can be used together with the existing HSE methodology to incorperate sheltering effects.

The tank is 1m square, the column of water is 1m tall and the undisturbed water depth is 0.5m. The still frames used to compile this animation were produced as part of a final year, undergraduate, project by Jonathon Shiach using software written in MATLAB.

Computer generated visualisation of the water surface showing the classical dam break problem. Water flows through an instantaneously formed breach in a dam. In the present results the water in the dam is 1.0m above datum, the dam breach is 1/4 of the dam width and the undisturbed water depth is 0.5m. Like the previous animation this was created by Jon Shiach as part of a final year project using software written in MATLAB.

This is the final animation by Jonathon Shiach. It shows the computed water surface resulting from the failure of a dam into a sluice containing a 90 degree bend. This demanding problem was one of a sequence of experimental tests, for validating dam break codes, performed by the European CADAM project. Further details of the test case, information about the CD-ROM of  experimental results and copies of the CADAM reports are available on the web.

Reviews of air pollution and urban canyon studies have established the need for more accurate methods of determining pollution dispersion. Literature detailing the historical evolution and current developments of the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method highlight its versatility, ease of implementation and suitability for parallel computers. Consequently, a pollution dispersion model has been developed as the first application of the LB method to 2D urban canyon flows. It is unique in that thermal, miscible tracer, fluid and wall layer turbulence effects have all been incorporated enabling 2D flow simulations at Reynolds numbers (Re) exceeding one million.

Tests on laminar Couette, Poiseuille, low Rayleigh number conduction, lid-driven cavity and convection-diffusion flow showed excellent agreement with analytical and numerical benchmark data. In turbulent Couette flow, errors from the first-order algebraic wall function and Smagorinsky subgrid scale model significantly reduced the intrinsic LB second-order accuracy. For well behaved single-phase flows in simple geometries CFD methods required less computer time and memory, but localised LB stream and collide operations are an advantage for multi-component flows in complex geometries.

Various 2D urban canyon configurations with different roof slope and surface temperatures have been tested at low Re, showing that the LB model reproduces significant flow features observed in wind tunnel and field measurements. Compared to high Re wind tunnel measurements the limited agreement is attributed to the non-negligible 3D component of the quasi-2D experiments, together with wall and turbulence modelling errors. Good quantitative agreement between the wind tunnel dataset and CFD model results indicate that further refinement is needed to make LB models competitive. High Re simulations using an urban canyon configuration reproduced the classic 2D skimming flow circulation, modified by thermal effects. Qualitative agreement with significantly 2D flow measurements from a field campaign in Nantes was obtained. Street level carbon monoxide measurements agreed with simulated concentrations, but accuracy was limited by uncertain emission estimates, wall and turbulence model errors and 3D flow effects.

This work shows that LB models, which are best suited to niche applications, require expansion to 3D, higher-order turbulent wall models and suitable turbulent inflow and outflow boundary conditions to be more effectively applied to urban canyon flows.

One of the most destructive and powerful events known to man is generated by oceanic floor movement, which can create a huge wave known as a tsunami. These waves can cause extensive damage when they inundate coastal regions and subsequent loss of life can often occur. Waves generated by landslides or rockslides into a body of water can also create similar waves known as mega-tsunamis.

The modelling of these complex events is required so predictions for wave generation, propagation and coastal run-up can be performed. The non-linear shallow water equations are implemented here to simulate this natural phenomena. Oneand two-dimensional flow solvers are presented which model solid vertical bodies using the Cartesian cut cell approach and uses the Surface Gradient Method to deal with bed topography. These methods have never previously been coupled. The solver is a modified MUSCL-Hancock Riemann based upwind scheme with the HLL approximate Riemann solver implemented at cell interfaces and an exact Riemann solver undertaken at moving solid boundaries. Grid generation is arbitrary, with a simple background stationary Cartesian mesh generated over the computation domain, with the boundaries of any solid body represented by different types of cut cells. A cell merging technique is used to ensure stability when small cut cells are merged with neighbouring cells allowing strict conservation to be retained at moving boundaries. The water surface level is used within the Surface Gradient Method, rather than water depth, to reconstruct the conservative variables at cell interfaces and the method has also been extended to deal with bed motion, for the first time.

The method has been shown to be successful for a variety of flow problems including fixed and moving solid boundaries, as well as for partially or fully submerged topography. Good agreement has been achieved between numerical and analytical solutions and different experimental studies have been replicated. The encouraging results obtained against these physical flume studies show promise for the scheme to be a relatively cheap computational solver for engineering purposes.

Finally, the events of the 1958 mega-tsunami in Lituya Bay have been modelled using the flow solver in both one- and two-dimensions and to the author's best knowledge these events have previously not been modelled using the non-linear shallow water equations. The one-dimensional numerical results have been compared to the results of a physical wave flume study, with reasonable agreement of wave amplitude and run-up observed.

The construction of sea walls requires accurate predictions of hazard levels. These are commonly expressed in terms of wave overtopping rates. A large amount of data related to wave overtopping has recently become available. Use of this data has allowed the development of artificial neural networks, which have the aim of accurately predicting wave overtopping rates. The available data cover a wide range of structural configurations and sea conditions. The neural networks created therefore constitute a unified, generic approach to the problem of wave overtopping prediction.

Neural network models are developed using two standard approaches: multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks and radial basis function (RBF) networks. A novel hybrid approach is then developed. The hybrid networks combine the properties of MLP and RBF networks. This is achieved firstly through a hybrid architecture, which contains artificial neurons of the types used in both MLP and RBF networks. Secondly, the hybrid networks are trained using a hybrid algorithm which combines the gradient descent method usually associated with MLP networks with a more deterministic forward-selection-of-centres method commonly used by RBF networks. The hybrid networks are shown to have better generalisation properties with the overtopping dataset than have basic MLP or RBF networks. They have been named 'global-local artificial neural networks' (GL-ANNs) to reflect their ability to model both global and local variation in an input-output mapping.

The properties of GL-ANNs are explored further through the use of a number of benchmark datasets. It is shown that GL-ANNs often contain fewer neurons than the corresponding RBF networks and have less need of regularisation when setting interneuronal weights. Some criteria for determining whether the GL-ANN approach is likely to be beneficial for a particular dataset are also developed. Such datasets are seen to be those that have inter-parameter relationships that operate on both a local and global level. The overtopping dataset used within this study is seen to be typical of such datasets.

Neural Network systems to solve military problems. Dr. McLean then returned to academia continuing his research in to techniques for improving generalisation and taking a central role within the Centre for Conversational Agents Research and the Adaptive Psychological Profiling Research Centre.

Whilst doing my MSc, I took the Neural Network option which was fascinating and I became very interested in the use of neural networks for processing images. For my MSc project I used feedforward neural networks to analyse facial images in order to classify faces in terms of gender and identity.

I gained six years teaching and research experience in China from 1989 to 1995. My first work began in March 1989 as an associate lecturer in measurement and control of mechanical systems. I was promoted to lecturer in 1992. During this six years, I carried out five research projects in areas of computer-aided measurement and control, vibration analysis, signal processing, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

In my final year as an undergraduate, it was necessary to produce a dissertation. The title of my project was An Intelligent Backgammon Opponent, which utilised various tree-searching algorithms in order to determine the best strategic move in the game.

Summary:                                                                               My current research project is on Conversational Agents. Conversational agents have usually utilised a simple pattern match approach to search the agent knowledge base to obtain a pre-hand-coded pattern that matches the user utterance. Since "the probability of two people using the same term in describing the same thing is less than 20%", this brings inherent drawbacks to conventional conversational agents. An exhaustive pattern set in a rule is required for a good agent database, compiling such a set is time-consuming and tedious. Moreover this compilation is probably very difficult to be exhaustive. Even if the pattern set is exhaustive, we hardly see much intelligence inside the agent itself. Therefore, a human-like conversational agent with understanding ability is expected to simplify the patterns in agent's knowledge base. This project is towards the development of a method measuring the similarity between meanings of two sentences. The similarity is derived from semantic analysis of main concepts in the sentence. The method is expected to be incorporated with conversational agents, to make them not only to exhibit intelligence on surface but also to process linguistic information like human inside the agent.

Summary:  Visual communication plays an important role in human communication and interaction.  Motion analysis offers significant advantages over the analysis of a single image.  In this research neural networks are used to extract relevant features from a motion sequence for psychological profiling purposes.

Summary: Logical Neural Networks (LNNs) differ from their connectionist counterparts in that they are composed of logic and memory devices and do not attempt to model structures in the brain closely. During training, patterns from a training set are presented and as learning takes place the RAMs gradually adapt. RAM contents can be saved and manipulated as binary strings, this should make Logical Neural Networks ideal candidates for training using a Genetic Algorithm. This project involves the use of Genetic Algorithms to select near optimum sets of input sub-vectors (inputs to a particular RAM).

Summary: Decision tree methodologies continue to provide a natural set of tools for extracting patterns from both symbolic and numeric data. Early models such as ID3 have undergone many modifications in an attempt to develop algorithms which can deal with noisy, incomplete and inconsistent information. Recent approaches have involved the use of fuzzy theoretical methods to create "fuzzy trees". By applying such approximate  reasoning techniques,  more flexible and robust decision trees have been  created. The fuzzy tree allows for gradual transitions to exist between attribute values, whilst simultaneously maintaining a degree of transparency in how the decision outcome was reached. Current work is being undertaken on the creation of fuzzy decision trees using a range of hybrid machine learning techniques.  This research expands on a novel Fuzzy Inference Algorithm (FIA) which was developed as part of my PhD thesis and is being extended to act as a multiple classifier.

Summary:Following on from previous research into Term Recognition and Extraction, this research will look at developing a connectionist based hybrid learning mechanism to recognise specific medical terms, in context, from medical corpus. Statistic and symbolic based auto-learning methods have already been developed. This will provide the basis of the evaluation.

Decision Tree induction systems are used for building transparent and highly accurate classification systems.  A popular decision tree induction technique used and recognised within the domain of Expert System is, the non-parametric statistical method, Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID).  Recent attempts to improve the efficiency of classification algorithm have involved the use of fuzzy theory to create fuzzy trees, which are able to deal with noisy or incomplete data.  My research involves the creation of fuzzy decision trees to tackle the problem of sharp decision boundaries that are generated when an attribute is selected for splitting.

The sloshing of a liquid wave with finite amplitude under the influence of gravity is a classical test case for free surface flow problems and more recently for evaluating interface tracking methodology (Ubbink 1997).

The second figure shows plots of the position of the interface at the left boundary against time for the first five periods where the theoretical solution for the first mode of the problem with period of sloshing P=0.3739s is also shown. As found by Tadjibaksh and Keller (1960), the second mode (which has been reflected in the numerical results) with half the above period is also important for this problem which accounts for slight differences between the predicted and the analytical values. In this figure, the predicted interface position using a volume fraction based method (Ubbink 1997) is also plotted and good agreement is found between the results from the two different methods, especially for the peak values of the interface position.

Secondly, the process of a 2-d body with wedge alike bottom entering and totally immersed into the initially calm water is sumulated. The final figure shows an animation of the simulated results, which shows the ability of the solver to capture the movement of interface including the break-up and the reconnection, and also to dealing with complex moving bodies.

This would result in making shorter and shorter searches. In order to escape a local minima a relatively large step must be taken. This can be achieved by performing a number of searches for a good step (when one is found the minima will have been escaped).

Once a set number1 of searches has been performed the algorithm infers that a global minima has been found. The steepness parameter for the trained neuron is now calculated according to the criteria set in the introduction.

At the end of each set of lecture notes, references will frequently given. These show the main sources of information used by the lecturer in preparing the lecture, so if you need more information, on specific points, these books may be a good place to start.

The information system function within an organisation can be seen as an intermediary between the business and the information technology infrastructure of the organisation. The role of the information system specialist is further illustrated by the system development lifecycle.

The chapter is devoted to the case study of Universal Home Stores (UHS). UHS has invested heavily in its IS / IT systems. All its stores are equipped with EPOS systems that interact with the merchandising and stock replenishment systems in the head office and the distribution centre. The organisation works on the basis of 'quick response supply' with stock sold one day been replenished overnight and then stock is reordered from suppliers using electronic data interchange (EDI). The sales and stock systems feed the management information systems, the accounting systems and interface electronically with the credit card companies used by UHS.

The overall IS / IT infrastructure is large and complex - the intention is to convey to the reader the extent of the IT infrastructure required by a large organisation. Don't be worried if you don't take in all the detail on a first read, we will be returning to the case study in subsequent chapters.

To introduce business we use a three layer IS business environment model. The model makes the point that the everyday functions of the business (operations layer) do not exist in isolation but in the context of the ownership, structure and culture of the organisation (management layer) and the society in which the business operates (environment layer). These three layers are relevant to the study of business but also to information systems which need to meet requirements at all levels of the organisation and often of business partners.

Following on from the IS business environment model the outer, environment level is discussed. There is a wide range of topics that could be covered but for the purposes of this book we concentrate on globalisation and the technological environment.

Structure: organisations have both formal and informal structures - there are a variety of approaches to structure and an appropriate structure is important to the efficient operation of the organisation.

Culture: like people, different companies have different personas - ruthless and efficient or concerned and approachable are two extremes. We look at company culture and the mission statements that may (or may not) embody that culture.

The aim is to give an overall introduction / understanding of how business is organised and managed and to relate these factors to IS and IT. The issue of strategy is also part of the management level but this is dealt with separately in chapter 5. There are many more aspects of organisation / management that could have been covered but those details are beyond the scope of this text.

The business environment in which the company operates. The strategy development process tries to anticipate future developments in this environment. The business environment was the subject of Chapter 3.

The capabilities and attributes of the company. The strategy development process must make a realistic assessment of the ability of the organisation to successfully cope with any proposed developments. The organisational level of the company is the subject of Chapter 6.

The strategy, once determined, guides the future development of the organisation. It may well affect the structure and culture of the organisation, topics that were among the subjects of Chapter 4. From time to time the strategy of an organisation will need updating to take account of further developments in the business environment. Sometimes the strategy will not seem to be working out and needs rethinking - the danger is that strategic development is replaced by short-term thinking to the detriment of the organisation and its stakeholders.

The formulation of strategy can be helped by the use of appropriate business models - in this chapter we will look at: SWOT, Porter's model of competitive forces and the Boston Consulting Group matrix.

The final layer of the IS business environment model is the operations level. The operations level is where the production process is carried out or where the service is delivered. The production process is most easily envisaged in a manufacturing company making cars, computers, paper clips or whatever. The operations / production level also includes organisations in primary industries, such as farming and mining, and in the service sector such as banking, health and education.

At home most people have a single PC with a dial up Internet connection to an ISP, and that is about it. At work we may also have a PC on our desks or possibly some specialist computer controlled equipment such as an EPOS terminal. If we work for a medium or large organisation our desk top or shop floor equipment will be joined to a local and / or wide area network and have access to a complex web of IT equipment and business information systems.

The organisation will have information systems for its core business activities. For a shop these are EPOS systems and stock replenishment; the bank needs ATM machines and systems that keeps records of its customers' transactions and the university has to have records of all its students and their progress through their studies. The complexity of these systems tends to increase with the size of the organisations, and large organisation will have multi-million investments in their main business systems.

In addition to their main business systems, organisations will have numerous small systems - some of these will be used by individuals and others will be at the department or company level. Examples of these systems are payroll, personnel, purchasing and accounting systems.

The third level of the IS infrastructure is desk top productivity aids such as word processing, spreadsheets and e-Mail. These are functions that we may use at home but at work they may be more structured with form letters, standard filing, archive procedures and security and privacy provisions across the whole infrastructure.

Payroll: All organisations have to pay their staff but many outsource the function to a specialist bureau. For the payroll system the organisation must update the standing data: details of the staff, rates of pay and any variances that apply that week or month. Once all the data is updated the payroll can be run, producing the pay and pay slip for the staff but also calculating pensions, tax and national insurance. To pay a large number of staff, reliably and on time, requires a well-designed and efficiently run system.

Order processing: Many organisations have significant order processing functions. At the retail end of the supply chain the business has to order in stock to put into its shop. Further down the supply chain the organisations will be both taking in orders from their customers and sending out replenishment orders to their suppliers. The order processing system has to hold data on the products and normally on customers and suppliers. The system processes incoming orders to produce picking lists, delivery notes and invoices. On the replenishment side it issues replenishment orders and then processes goods-in and invoices.

Payroll and order processing are just two of the systems that an organisation might use - they are selected to illustrate the nature of information systems, their complexity and some of the issues that arise when such systems are designed.

Electronic commerce (e-Commerce) is the formulation of commercial transactions at a site remote from the trading partner and then using electronic communications to execute that transaction (Whiteley, 2000).

EDI was developed as a way of codifying structured data, such as orders and invoices.  The EDI standard gives an application-independent and machine-independent way of encoding business transactions.  EDI, when used in conjunction with a value added data service (VADS), allows senders to choose when and how to send their transactions and receivers to pick them up and decode them at a time convenient to themselves.

EDI decreases the time taken to exchange and process trade documents from several days to a matter of hours - it can be as quick as the trading partners need it to be and it removes the costs and errors associated with data entry from paper documents.  EDI facilitates just-in-time manufacture and quick response supply.

These areas are more problematic for some classes of products and for some customers than to others. Organisations that run e-Shops and people who design them need to be aware of the problems and to ensure that their e-Shop does as much as it can to reassure and provide good service.

Most IS / IT applications use the computer's abilities for high speed calculation, data manipulation, communication and large scale data storage - this applies to all the applications discussed, thus far, in this section of the book.

There are, however, many tasks that require more than just calculation and data manipulation - they require judgement which is a part of intelligence. Computers are not intelligent but we can use their capabilities to simulate intelligence - this area of research and application is known as artificial intelligence (AI).

KBS are also referred to as expert systems. A KBS is set up with a database of 'knowledge' - 'facts' from the problem domain coded in some knowledge representation formalism, typically 'if - then' rules. The system can then be fed with details of a problem and will use its 'knowledge' to give expert advice. How a KBS is set up and how it operates is further explained in the chapter.

The alternative approach to AI is the neural network. This is a attempt to use the computer to simulate human thought processes. It is a newer process than KBS and still the subject of extensive research.

AI systems are used for a number of applications where conventional computing is not appropriate. Early KBS packages tended to concentrate on the field of medical diagnostics. More recent application areas have included in the fields of fault detection, financial advice and fraud detection.

The basic function of most business information systems is the processing of business transactions: processing orders, selling insurance, maintaining a bank account or whatever. The processing of those business transactions produces data, large volumes of data, and this in turn can be used for the production of management information.

Systems range in size from single user desk top applications to corporate information systems with hundreds or thousands of users. The software may be bought in or could have been developed specifically for the application. Bought-in applications range in size (and price) from the ubiquitous Microsoft package to large enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This range of systems requires a range of IT provision, starting with the desk top PC and ranging up to the central mainframe or corporate server.

We start our study of information technology with the computer system. The sort of computer we normally see is a personal computer (PC). The personal computer runs desk top productivity packages like word processing and spreadsheets. For the business user it can also run small applications and for the home user it may also be used for games.

The chapter starts with a look at the way that the computer works. It is a very brief look, just enough to dispel some of the mystery and possibly give some idea why some processes work well on computers and others can be more problematic or time consuming.

Modern computers, used by individuals and organisations, hold large amounts of data. The data may be in textual form, such as word processed documents and stored e-Mails, or it may be business system data recording business and financial transactions. The data may be owned or used by one individual, accessed by a number of people in the organisation, or be shared with other organisations or the public.

For the data to be usable it has to be organised and structured, and the basic element of that structure is the file. The file is the unit that is recognised by the operating system and is accessed by the program.

The file is composed of a set of records. The file must have a data structure to give efficient access to the record, and the record must have a structure that that is known to any application that is required to use it. For many applications the data structures are crucial to the viability of the system. For a large, multi-user system, get the file data structure wrong and the system will grind to a halt. The three basic ways of organising and accessing data are serially, using an index (index sequential) or calculating the position of the record (hash random). These three file data structures, together with the way they relate to the hardware and system requirements, are the subject of this chapter.

Many applications require access to a number of data sets, and this can be organised using a database management system. Databases still use the basic file data structures but provide for sophisticated ways of accessing data while hiding the complexity from the application. Databases are the subject of the next chapter.

To facilitate access to the data, the database needs to be set up using sophisticated data structures. The most common approach is the relational model but hierarchical, network and object-oriented approaches are also used. Before the database is set up, the data must be analysed and structured to work with the approach taken in the database software.

Database software can be used free standing or be incorporated into an information system. Many database packages come with built-in application generators that can be used for ad-hoc queries or for building operational information systems.

The combination of computer systems with network technologies has changed the nature of information systems and has created radical new ways of working, trading and communicating. The use of information and communications technologies is the facilitator of globalisation (with helpful and harmful effects) and the (so called) information age.

The information system designer uses a network to ensure the efficient operation of a system. Designers need to be aware of the networking requirements of their systems, organisation and external stakeholders.

Distributed system - a system that involves processing and / or data located on a number of servers. A distributed system may be a closely coupled system within the organisation or it may be inter-organisational and require a much more open architecture.

In a networked system, requests for processing arrive in from terminals, or other parts of the system, in a random manner. This complicates the design of the IS and is something the IS practitioner needs to take account of when designing a networked information system.

Iterative / prototype lifecycles - analysis, design and development take place simultaneously using a series of system prototypes. We start with an initial prototype, aimed at discovering requirements, and then iterate it, adding functionality and refining the design, until an acceptable system is produced.

We looked at the lifecycle in the last chapter and, in this chapter (and with a bit of practice) we will learn these four ways of modelling and designing the system. It is noted that most chapters in this book are intended to be covered as a single unit of study (a lecture and a tutorial / self study). This chapter will take considerably longer, say four units of study.

In the section on relational data analysis there is an error in the Second Normal Form column of figure 12.10.  The bicycle attributes have been assigned to the bicycle entity (key bike-reg-no) and should have been removed from the rental line (key: rental-no + bike-reg-no).

An object is a self-contained module of data and its associated processing. The job of object-oriented (OO) systems analysis and design (SA&D) is to interpret user requirements in terms of objects that can then be implemented as software using OO technologies.

It is noted that most chapters in this book are intended to be covered as a single unit of study (a lecture and a tutorial / self study). This chapter will take considerably longer, say four units of study.

The basic way of inputting information into a computer system is by typing on a keyboard that is used in conjunction with a template displayed on the screen. This process is slow, costly and error prone. Any improvement that can be achieved by good design is to be welcomed. For some systems the screen and keyboard can be substituted by devices such as barcode readers and mark sensing devices - these, and other available technologies, need to be considered by the system designer.

The main way of outputting business transactions and management information is to print them. Output documents need to be timely and informative and it is the job of the system designer to ensure these aims are achieved. Some outputs are to devices other than the printer, for example display screens or electronic transmissions to other systems.

System analysis and design (SA&D) is only one aspect of the creation of an information system. SA&D is key to achieving a well designed system that is efficient and meets the user's requirements. The process of SA&D leads on to the production (or purchase) of software and takes place within the overall structure of a project team.

Information systems projects are notorious for running late and costing a great deal more than the originally planned budget. To minimise these problems it is essential that the project is thoroughly planned and actively managed.

The information system also needs to be fit for purpose, it needs to be reliable and to meet the business requirement. This aspect of the project requires close user involvement, thorough testing and quality management.

The widespread availability and use of IT is changing the way we work, the way we organise our lives and the way we are governed. We are, it is suggested, moving from the industrial age to become an information society.

As IT / IT professionals we are part of this transformation - what are our duties and responsibilities? We look at the role of professional organisations and, in particular, the British Computer Society.

The use of IS and IT permeates nearly all aspects of economic and social activity. As with all such activity there is a legal angle. The law is used to regulate legitimate activity, for example contracts, and it is used to outlaw inappropriate activities, for example malicious damage and theft.

Computer Misuse Act (1990) - this applies to the unauthorised use of computing facilities. The offence is aggravated where there is an intent of committing a serious criminal offence or making unauthorised changes to data or programs.

ICTs and their applications are developing all the time. In that developing field the role of the IS specialist remains the same - to design and deliver IS systems that fulfil the needs of the organisation and help it to play its proper role within society. This book is an introductory course that provides a basic education and training for the IS specialists of the future.

Electronic Commerce (e-Commerce) is a general concept covering any form of business transaction or information exchange executed using information and communication technologies (ICTs).  e-Commerce takes place between companies, between companies and their customers, or between companies and public administrations.  Electronic Commerce includes electronic trading of goods, services and electronic material (Esprit, 1997).

EDI provides for the efficient transaction of recurrent trade exchanges between commercial organisations.  EDI is widely used by, for example, large retail groups and vehicle assemblers when trading with their suppliers.

The production of goods and services is the result of the efforts of many organisations - a complex web of contracts and co-operation known as the supply chain or the value system.  The structure of the value system varies greatly between business sectors and sometimes between different organisations within a sector.

Commercial organisations only survive if they are competitive; they prosper if they achieve a competitive advantage.  The two generic competitive strategies are price leadership and product differentiation.  The threats to a competitive position are explained using Porter's model.

Chapter 4 looks at the strategic implications of e-Commerce and suggests that, unlike most other IS and IT facilities, it has the potential to redefine corporate strategy as opposed to being a component within the implementation of that overall strategy.

Passenger air transport was one of the early users of e-Commerce, in this case electronic markets.  Early innovations of airline booking systems, such as United and American Airlines, gained competitive advantage from the deployment of their systems and, even after the elimination of various anti- competitive features, continued to gain significant business value.  The use of airline booking systems by travel agents gave access to a wealth of information and was an important element in creating what is now a fiercely competitive market in air travel.

With the advent of Internet e-Commerce, the air transport industry is again at the forefront of e-Commerce developments with each of the larger airlines providing for on-line bookings and, in many cases, linking this into their frequent flyer programs and electronic check-in facilities at the airport.

The Internet e-Commerce developments have the potential to, once again, restructure the market.  A move away from the direct use of airline booking systems could de-emphasise price competition. A shift to direct on-line booking also threatens the role of the travel agent as an intermediary but possibly opens the market for a new breed of on-line intermediaries.

The topic of this chapter is the first of the three e-Commerce 'technologies', the electronic market.  The application of this technology is relatively limited and the coverage of the topic has been similarly restricted (with most of the material on business to business transactions being concentrated on EDI).

Electronic markets are used for passenger ticket reservations and in various financial and commodity markets.  These markets give the customer (or the customer's intermediary) easy access to comparative data on price, and other attributes, of the goods or services on offer.  Access to this information is advantageous for the consumer but making the information available is not necessarily beneficial to the supplier.

This chapter discusses new systems that are being developed and deployed for the purchase of 'non production' goods (stationary, computer supplies, travel, etc.).  Some of these systems are no more than the commercial use of e-Shops but a number of multiple supplier or multiple customer to multiple supplier systems (in some cases referred to as 'vortals') are being deployed and these could legitimately be seen as a new generation of electronic markets.

The technical elements of EDI are relatively simple; of much more significance is the impact of EDI on the business.  The use of electronic trading in an organisation can be part of a project to re-engineer the supply chain and can facilitate changes in the nature of the product that is offered to the consumer.

Business to consumer e-Commerce on the Internet is an area of rapid development.  The chapter outlines the range of goods and services available, the nature of an online shop, and the phases of the trade cycle that the web can facilitate - these areas are dealt with in more detail in subsequent chapters.

The Internet was born as a US military project and developed as an academic and research network.  The use of the Internet by members of the general public and the commercial use of the Internet is a relatively recent phenomenon.  The commercial use of the Internet involves service providers, content providers and software facilities; the chapter introduces the various categories of players and the range of services and facilities they offer.

EDI and Electronic Markets are appropriate to specific trade sectors, trade cycles and parts of the trade cycle.  Internet commerce has, however, the potential for a wider applicability.  It can be used for marketing in the pre-sale phase of the trade cycle; for sales the execution and settlement phases and / or in the after-sales phase.

Despite the development of Internet e-Commerce and the hype that surrounds it, the amount of business done online as a proportion of all retail sales remains stubbornly small.  This chapter looks at e-business applications and, through the use of mini case studies, examines the scope of e-Business on the Internet and the factors that lead to a successful retail web operation.

Internet based commerce, just one of the many applications on the Internet, is still at an early stage of development.  It is set to become an important commercial channel and its wide availability and diversity will ensure it a developing role.  However, as with other new forms of commerce, it too will settle down as just one of a range of ways of doing business.

This chapter looks at all forms of e-Commerce in their wider commercial context.  It concludes that each way of doing business has a role to play and that the road to competitive advantage, for many organisations, is in the integration of appropriate e-Commerce technologies throughout the supply chain.

Continuing with the online bookshop theme, consider ways that a bookshop could seek to achieve cost leadership, differentiation and focus.  Make notes suggesting the strategy that could be applied in each case.  Note that simple discounting is not to be considered a satisfactory strategy if the result is that the bookshop ends up in bankruptcy.

Using the material from the proceeding exercises, suggest how the college or university might further promote itself using the Internet (note that the institution probably already has a web page and the requirement is for imaginative new initiatives over and above this provision).

If appropriate an alternative trade sector can be selected as the subject of the study, possible organisations include the student union, the local bus company or any other organisation with which the student has familiarity.  It is appreciated that students will not, at this stage of the course, have all the background necessary to fully answer these questions; however with appropriate use of general knowledge and imagination a useful answer can be given that will help reinforce the understanding of the strategic process.

Atlantic or trans Pacific and should be from one major airline hub to another (so that there will be several competing carriers); examples could be London or Frankfurt to New York or San Francisco to Tokyo.  The dates should be two or three months hence for, say, Friday to Monday at Easter or 23 December to 02 January.

Note the price comparisons between the airlines and, in particular any price differential between the airline site and the online travel agent.  Compare notes on your bookings and of any fellow students doing the same exercise.

Draw a system diagram of Pens and Things using any diagramming convention you deem appropriate (or as directed by the tutor).  The diagram to include trade exchanges with customer and supplier organisations.

In general, electronic markets are not accessible by members of the general public.  Chapter 5 has already suggested that students should access the airline booking systems via an appropriate Internet travel agent; this should have given some idea about the operation of an electronic market.

Draw up an Interchange Agreement to cover the exchange of orders and invoices between Packaging Solutions and Pens and Things.  You may use model agreements obtained from the web (or elsewhere) but the agreement must be fully tailored to the needs of these two organisations.

Draw up a plan for the implementation of EDI at Pens and Things.  The plan is initially for the interchange of orders with Packaging Solutions but should take account of possible future developments.  The plan should be no more than two pages long, state any assumptions you have made.

EDI is typically applied to trade exchanges, orders, invoices, etc. but it can also be used for non trade purposes.  In the UK, students apply for university places through the UCAS clearing centre (and other countries may have similar schemes).  The procedure is that students submit their applications to UCAS and the clearing centre passes the application onto the preferred universities.  Each university then accept, reject or make an offer and the decision is passed back to the student via the UCAS clearing centre.  Suggest how EDI (and other ICT technologies) might be used to update such a scheme.

If you are not already an experienced user of Internet e-Commerce, then look up a few sites to see what they look like.  Use your favourite search engine to find two or three online bookshops.  Use the search facility but also check out any adverts or menu items that click through to an online bookstore.  Look up this book and any other course books and compare prices, delivery times and shipping charges.  After you have looked up the book, jot down three reasons why you might buy the book online and three why it might not be advantageous.

It is probably not a good idea to include home addresses and telephone numbers - there are plenty of nuts out there on the net.  Preferably don't be too tasteless - the ISP might object and certainly the university will if the page is to be on their server.

An underlying theme of this chapter is that while Internet e-Commerce might be a very attractive facility to many customers it does not solve all shopping problems for everyone that might use it.  There are two exercises given and both reflect this theme.

Identify a sector not covered in the chapter and carry out a similar investigation.  Sectors that might be chosen are insurance, fashion, cosmetics, etc.  Choose a sector that sells tangible goods and one that offers a service and contrast the two.

For business-to-business transactions the trade cycle typically involves the provision of credit with execution preceding settlement whereas in consumer-to-business these two steps are typically co-incident.

It has been well documented that IS evaluation is intrinsically problematical due, principally, to difficulty in assessing intangible benefits and attributing causality in relation to benefit achievement.  e-Commerce has proved difficult to evaluate; the discrepancy between trading profits of internet companies and their stock market valuations is a symptom of the problems.

The range of factors which need to be considered when evaluating e-Commerce is diverse. The Group has evolved a model for evaluating e-Commerce in organizations which encompasses external factors such as consumer behaviour and competitor activity and internal factors such as distribution and system performance, see Figure 3. The model brings together business and technical operations within the organization into a four phase evaluation process.

Information systems are often specialist applications and, in some cases, they are very large systems. Desktop packages such as word processors and spreadsheets are also used for business applications (in effect individual information systems). List some business applications of desktop applications.

Make a list of 10 organisations you have come into contact with today (or over the last couple of days) and classify them using Wild's four categories. Note whether your interaction with those organisations involved or was facilitated by ICTs.

Look up 'globalisation' on the web and examine the different definitions you can find there. Globalisation is a controversial process and there is a substantial anti-globalisation movement involving development charities and various left wing organisations. Debate the case for and against globalisation.

Look up the Ford web site (ford.com seems more useful than ford.co.uk) and see if they are reporting any new developments. Also use other sources to look up news items on Ford (guardianunlimited.co.uk is a useful source). See whether Ford are progressing in solving its organisational and over-capacity problems or if it is still in turmoil. Possibly turmoil is the natural state of business in a rapidly changing, globalised world?

Take the list of organisations you identified in Chapter 3, Exercise 1 and note down who or what you think owns the organisation. Consider whether the mode of ownership is appropriate and how it affects your experience of its services.

Consider your college or university department. Find out which members of staff have responsibility for what (course leader, etc.) and construct an organisational structure chart. You may well end up with a matrix chart. Compare your chart with that produced by fellow students and any official organisational chart - there may well be (legitimate) different interpretations of the same data.

Look up the mission statement or your college or university. Assess how well you feel it meets the aims set out in that statement and consider whether its aims adequately meet your needs as a student. If you have a part-time job with a large organisation, see if you can find the mission statement of that organisation and check out how those objectives fit the organisation as you experience it.

List the major car brands and suggest which of Porter's three generic competitive advantages they seem to be attempting to achieve. For some manufacturers you may identify different models with different aims - discuss any problems this may give raise to.

Check out the SWOT analysis of the author's university refectory (see figure 5.3) and see how that compares with the refectory that is available at your place of study. Prepare a SWOT analysis for another organisation you are familiar with - the bookshop where you bought this book or the college / university department in which you are studying.

Assume that you are running a rail passenger service - London to Manchester is the example I normally use. Use Porter's model to assess its competitive position (note that some of the four forces are less significant than others for this case).

Consider the environmental changes that are likely to affect your university or college department. Also consider the strengths and weaknesses of the department and suggest two or three pathways the department could choose as its strategy for growth and / or development over the coming years. Your answer to question 2 could feed into the first part of this question.

Choose a couple of products, say computer games and a new breakfast cereal, and consider how they should be marketed. Does the marketing of the product rely on intermediaries or can the product be sold direct? How does the use of intermediaries affect the marketing process?

Take an organisation you know (for example your college or university). List the types of supplies it needs to purchase and from where these might be sourced. Assess how crucial the purchasing function is to the operation of the organisation.

Take the system diagram given in the sub-section on production and apply it to specific industries - making computers and cornflakes or providing insurance and education. Substitute specifics for the input and output categories and assess the relative importance of each category to the selected industry.

IT provision in universities is somewhat different from most organisations. There is an administrative requirement, provision for academics and some specialist computers but the vast majority of users are students with their own special requirements and behaviour patterns. Check out how IT is structured and supported in your university or college - draw a structure chart for the IT staff.

Orders may be sent in on paper and then they have to be keyed into the system - this takes time and can be error prone. What other media / methods can be used to submit orders and what are the advantages / disadvantages of each approach?

A flight to New York. Choose a set of dates, e.g. the first Friday in February and returning the following Monday. Set out from your home town choosing the most convenient airport but balancing that with getting a good deal (and if you live in North America set the destination as Paris).

You have come to university / college with your expensive new PC and you are now rather worried about the level of thefts from student accommodation. A large dog is one possibility but seems a bit impracticable. Get online and find some insurance for your PC that would suit your circumstances and your budget.

Conceivably, AI systems could replace humans in many decision making processes. What are the social and ethical implications consequent on handing over the decision making process to machines? Applications could possibly include university admission, student assessment, judgements in criminal cases - consider these and / or similar examples. Suitable for a tutorial discussion.

Many readers of this book will have recently joined a college or university. To gain a place you will have filled in an application form that was then assessed by the admissions tutor. Let us assume that we are looking at a course in a prestigious university. It has an equal opportunities admissions policy, we have three candidates and one place to fill. All three candidates have two As and a B in their GCSE A-level exams and good references from their school. Dipesh went to a well known local public school and has been an active participant in the sports, social and community activities offered at that school. Andrew comes from Liverpool and has been at a comprehensive school in a run down part of town - he does not include many out of school activities in his application. Louise comes from Stratford upon Avon, attended the town's grammar school and is just finishing a 'year out' on a community project in Mexico. Is the decision of the admissions tutor structured or unstructured? How can he / she fairly decide between these three candidates? Should there be some form of rating system and what factors should be included?

The government is greatly exercised by setting targets, monitoring performance against those targets and then finding excuses when the target is not achieved. Further and higher education is not exempt from this process. Areas where targets have been set include recruitment from less privileged backgrounds (by various ethnic and socio-economic categories) and the dropout rates of students after they start their courses (at each stage of the course). Your college or university wants to monitor the achievement of these targets across all its departments. Choose one of these target areas and sketch an analysis, key target and exception report for the requirement (make up some target figures if you need to). Assess the appropriateness of each report to the management information requirement.

List advantages and disadvantages of purchasing packaged software as opposed to house development. Suggest circumstances where packaged software would be advised and where a bespoke, in-house development might be more appropriate.

Using the data flow diagram (DFD) of the payroll system, shown in Chapter 8, suggest what conventional file type would be most appropriate for each of the datastores shown on the DFD. Assume each datastore is to be implemented as a file. Give reasons for your suggestion.

Set up the order processing system, we have been using as an example in this chapter, as an Access database - use the instructions given on the web page if you are unfamiliar with MS Access. Take care to select appropriate data types for each attribute and make the appropriate key settings (this may not matter for a small example database but it is illustrative of the procedures we would follow if we were setting up a serious facility).

Check out the facilities of the computer labs in your university or college. What are the network facilities and what are they used for? Is the software / data you access on the local drive or on one or more networked servers?

You probably have a mobile phone. Do you use any of the digital (as opposed to voice) services that are provided? The prediction is that mobile access to ISs will increase. What use do you (and your fellow students) see for such services?

For the Madcaster University case study apply relational data analysis to both the student registration and the module choice forms. Take the third normal form from each analysis, merge them and produce an ER diagram that represents the result. Compare your ER diagram to the one you produced in exercise 3.

For the High Peak Bicycles case study I have written a use case description (in two formats) for rent out. Select the approach you feel comfortable with and write your own use case description for the rent return use case.

Revise the Madcaster University preliminary class diagram you drew in exercise 3 to be a design class diagram. This should include any of the additional class diagram features that are appropriate to the requirement and the outcomes of the sequence diagrams you produced in exercise 5.

Consider the screen designs suggested for student registration at Madcaster University. Accepting the data requirements shown on the sample screens, have you any suggestions for improving on the design?

In this chapter I set out what seems to be the less than ideal state of train information available on railway stations. How could this situation be improved? Are there any alternative technologies that could be utilised to make sure that individual passengers have easy access to the information they need?

Work out the dependencies (they should be fairly obvious) and draw a PERT chart. Identify the critical path and the minimum elapse time (people only do a five day working week). We have six weeks before the start of term - can we do it?

In Chapter 23 you are to be asked to do a team project to analyse, design and implement a small database system. List the major activities involved in this assignment. Assuming a team of three and four weeks to do the project, draw a project plan.

Think about the systems that (probably) hold your personal details. Are there any systems you can think of in addition to those indicated in this chapter? Use a tutorial session to compare notes and find out if any of your colleagues have been inconvenienced by personal data held on computers.

The police use finger prints in their detective work and there is increasing use of DNA analysis. Finger prints and DNA details are kept on a computer system that can be used for matching when fresh evidence is found. Currently data is held for people who have a conviction but there have been proposals to include additional groups such as immigrants or the whole population. Discuss what is appropriate.

Computer systems are used for a wide variety of applications and in countries with differing degrees of democracy, corruption and / or repression. Are there any computer applications you would not be prepared to work on? Are there any applications or types of data that should not be computerised? These questions could also be discussed in a tutorial.

An EDI system for trade with the supermarkets.  Getting the supermarkets to stock the product is not necessarily going to be easy (there are more products available than the supermarkets have room for).  If the supermarkets do accept the product, EDI could be a condition of trade.  EDI will not be cheap for Higging- bottoms to install (although there are short cuts that small firms can use).

Expatriate Yorkshire folks who have possibly accumulated 'a bit of brass' would very possibly be prepared to pay a premium price for a taste of their home county.  A web site could be set up reasonably cheaply and could do very well.  Hampers including Yorkshire specialities such as curt tarts and Hendersons Relish could be a new line (Eh lad, you can't beat a splash of Hendersons on your bangers and mash).

Agents are a traditional sales channel but have been dropped by many insurance companies on the grounds of cost.  Their advantage is that they can provide the personal touch, particularly the elderly and other vulnerable groups (who might not be the most lucrative customers).  A good agent attracts customer loyalty and will sell further company products to existing customers.

Brokers outsource the task of selling insurance and can have a lower cost base.  A good broker acts for the customer in sorting out the most competitive product for the customer's requirements - a process that is liable to push down the margins of the insurance providers.  A bad broker is as much concerned with the level of commission as the customers best interests - a process that tends to increase the cost of sales for the insurance company.  The broaker may well use e-Commerce links for dealing with insurance companies but is unlikely to use such links with clients.

Direct Sales have become viable with the introduction of IT in the sales office - telesales are cheaper than either an agent system or dealing through a broker - the cost of Internet sales is even less once the system is established.  The systems are appropriate for standard insurance transactions but could be considered less so for more complex insurance where some more personal advice from a trained (and honest) salesperson could help.

Factors to be considered are the number of suppliers, the number and nature of the transactions and the importance of inbound logistics to the organisation's operations.  For organisations that are heavily dependant on large numbers of standardised transactions (e.g. vehicle assemblers and multiple retailers) electronic trading is going to be vital.  For organisations that buy smaller quantities or very specialised inputs, formal systems of e-Commerce are less relevant and may be inappropriate.

The (general) role of the intermediary is to facilitate trade where there are miss-matches in the scale of the supplier and the end user.  Large producers can deal efficiently with large customers but not with a myriad of small trade customers or consumers.  Customers can deal with a moderate number of important suppliers but not with a myriad suppliers where trade volumes are low.  Intermediaries generally deal with commodity products and can have effective e-Commerce links with suppliers and with (trade) customers.

The firm may be dealing with many customers selling relatively standardised products in volume of it may have specialised products and relatively few customers.  For volume sales some form - of e-Commerce may be used or be applicable - for specialised products or services it is more likely that sales will be made through personal contacts.

Amazon.com started in the early days of the commercial use of the Internet and its rapid acquisition of market share took the conventional (bricks and mortar) bookstore chains by surprise.  The conventional bookstores are however fighting back with new bookstore formats, sharper merchandising practices and their own online bookstores.  Profitability in the whole sector has been affected by competition for market share - amazon.com has yet to post a profit and some of the conventional bookstore chains (Chapters in Canada for example) are also having liquidity problems.

The book trade has, traditionally been a cosy sector with the retail price of books being set by the publishers and fairly standard trade discounts on that price being offered to both large and small retailers.  Over recent years this position has been challenged by large retailers, e.g. supermarkets, seeking volume discounts on popular titles.  This position has been pushed further by amazon.com with aggressive demands for discounting from the publishers.  The other large booksellers (Borders, Waterstones, etc.) are also large customers of the publisher and are able to match the demands made by amazon.com.  The suppliers are not in a strong position to resist - some have and the booksellers have simply stopped stocking their titles (although they still need to be in a position to meet their customers requirements).

Over recent years and, in particular with online booksellers, there has been a trend to offering discounts on an increasing number of titles - the customer can shop around for the best deal (and online there are 'shopbots' that will search out the online bookstore that is offering the best price on a given title).

It is relatively easy to set up an e-Shop.  However, e-Shops such as amazon.com now have very sophisticated web sites and considerable investment in their supply chain infrastructure - they also have brand name recognition (amazon.com is currently the best recognised brand on the net).  Setting up a large, general purpose, online bookstore and getting customers to know about that bookstore and to use it is not going to be easy and is not going to be cheap (bol.com is a recent start-up that has taken on amazon.com in Europe but it is backed by a very large German media group).  Most of the large, conventional book retailers have now set up online bookstores - they had the advantage that they could use their existing supply chain arrangements to feed the online bookstore - they have not achieved the brand name recognition of amazon.com.  It is perhaps doubtful that we will see many / any new entrants into this market, the costs of matching the infrastructure and brand recognition of amazon.com are just too great.

It has been argued that, for this online market, there will be just two or three organisations that have significant presence and that could be right (an online retailer can not find a location that is not served by its competitors as a net presence serves all locations).  Arguably each non English language market is a different market and it will be interesting to see developments in that field (amazon already have a German site).

Disintermedisation:  The publishers could sell direct to the public - after all, excepting best sellers, many books are supplied to the retailer in ones and twos and if the order is taken online there is very little more work in selling direct - and no trade discount has to be given.

Electronic Publishing:  If information is to be selected from electronic information banks and paid for in micro payments then there is no books and no bookshops - but to adapt a famous quote, the news of the death of the book has (probably) been greatly exaggerated.

The cosy years of book retailing are now over.  Online booksellers are providing real competition for the bricks and mortar booksellers and those conventional booksellers are competing among themselves with, for example, expanding bookshop chains knocking out long established local bookshops.  The conventional bookshops are also (arguably) fighting back with enlarged ad updated shops that make for a very pleasant environment to browse and select a book.

The problem is that margins have been eroded and a retailer may well be doing useful business but be unable to cover their costs.  Interestingly (or perversely) financial institutions seem keen to support loss-making e-Tailers but not conventional stores that might be struggling.

Interestingly the conventional retailers are moving to offer mix modes, for example - order online and pick up at the bookstore - the outcome is unpredictable but, hopefully, the customers will retain a choice.

These factors are, however offset to a degree by the investment in ICT systems and the cost of delivery to customers (a cost conventional bookstores do not have).  Amazon has achieved a degree of cost leadership but at the cost of continuing losses - a position that might not be sustainable.

Arguably the way to achieve cost leadership is to concentrate on the best seller market - buy in bulk and sell at a discount.  Some supermarkets have made some effort in this direction and if that trade became substantial it could hurt all specialist book retailers.

Differentiation:  Arguably the conventional retailers and the online retailers are very different (and as noted in answer 1 they are best suited to different parts of the market).  The online retailers are attempting to differentiate themselves with technologies such as 'one click' and next day delivery (in selected locations) but these innovations are easily copied (unless the courts rule to the contrary!).

Focus:  This is about not being a general bookstore but specialising in a particular segment of the market.  Specialist bookstores can be found online for dog lovers, horror afficionadoes and doubtless many other requirements - they also need to differentiate themselves and create a sense of community as doubtless amazon, et al. would also provide most of the titles they are able to stock.  A further example of focus is the campus or airport bookstore, both of which have the advantage of location and of specialist local knowledge.

Changes in the economy - if the economy is doing well then further / higher education might seem more affordable but there is a temptation to take a job - if the economy is not doing well then further / higher education might be less affordable but conversely becomes more important in the job market.

To be a top academic institution with a reputation based on research excellence (most universities seem to assume that this is their aim but, realistically, only a small number of institutions will achieve it).

Product Promotion:  Put the college or university on the web (well most institutions have done that) - make the web page a good one with information that is relevant to students searching for a place to study.

New Sales Channel:  The college or university web site should provide for students to apply for courses online (or express an interest in countries where university application is through a clearing house system).

Time to Market:  Universities tend to take a long time to develop new courses and even longer to make them available to students - an online prospectus could dramatically cut the lead time on getting publicity out to potential students.

Customer Relations:  Appropriate online information and prompt and appropriate response to queries will enhance the reputation of the institution (or at least - a failure to provide these facilities will damage the reputation).

Send promotional material electronically to local schools (as opposed  to waiting for them to visit - this could link to a special version of the web site or (for example) and online video presentation.

An electronic delivery note indicates the goods are on their way and it works well in the information system but it does not prove that the goods have actually been delivered - it can be supplemented with (say) bar codes on the packets in the consignment.

Electronic (EDI) payment requires a electronic funds transfer (EFT) to the suppliers bank and a payment advice to the supplier - not a problem but more involved than the other transactions in the trade cycle.

The use of fax in place of paper orders obviously has some effect in 'shortening ordering time' - at the very least it cuts out the time in the post.  Use of fax at the customer end and at the supplier end only shortens processing time if fax orders are given priority over paper orders sent / arriving through the post.  It is possible to automate the sending of faxes as direst output from the purchasing system - such a facility also eliminates the time spent paper handling at the customer end.

The use of fax does nothing to 'cut costs' (it may well be more expensive), does not 'eliminate errors' (faxed orders have to be typed in just like any other order) and neither does it provide a 'fast response'.

The use of fax orders also has no significant advantage over paper orders in terms of 'accurate invoicing', 'payments', 'reduced stock holding', or 'cash flow'.  Also there is no gain in 'business opportunity' or 'customer lock-in'.

The EDI Delivery Note becomes, in effect, a despatch notification and has then to be supplemented by the input of a goods-in confirmation when the goods arrive at the customer site.  This can be just a code and a bar-code label system is often used.

The processing of paper invoices can be a labour intensive task and, where queries do arise, delays to payment will often be considerable.  Electronic invoicing can be a substantial cost saving and can eliminate most of the delays.

Other than the set-up costs of the system there are no significant disadvantages to electronic Invoicing.  Note that some trading partners have eliminated the Invoice stage with the customer paying on delivery or self invoicing (think about it - the invoice stage provides no real information except price and that can be in the contract or on the delivery note).

The final stage is Payment.  Full electronic payment consists of an electronic funds transfer (EFT) to the supplier's bank and an electronic payment advice to the supplier.  Electronic payment might be executed using a banking system (such as BACS in the UK) or it can be executed using (non proprietary) EDI.

The electronic payment process needs to be based on trust.  There is little advantage in having an electronic advice note if the banking of the corresponding payment if the corresponding payment is then checked manually (although this too could be automated using an electronic statement from the bank).

EDI is of greatest advantage to the large (hub) organisation and, generally, of less advantage to the smaller supplier organisation.  The supplier organisation has the cost of implementing EDI when its volume of transactions may mean that it gains no real advantage (if, for example they only get 5 orders a week they hardly need a computer based order processing system, let alone EDI).  Also, if the supplier is using EDI for just-in-time or quick response supply then the costs of stock holding can be passed back down the logistics chain to the supplier.

After processing the application / interviewing the student each university sends its offer / rejection to the clearing house (in the UK an offer can be 'unconditional' or 'conditional' on the grades obtained to be in the 'A level' (final school year leaving) exams).

Getting the applicants to complete the form on a computer and submit it over the web.  This is attractive but the form would need to be tied up with the confidential reference material and there would need to be acceptable authentication procedures.

The instances given in the book are where customer preferences can be quickly fed into the production planning process so that the EDI enabled JIT production process can quickly and cheaply produce a product that matches individual customer requirements (within the options offered).

These services obviously require some notice - possibly the notice period could be shortened with electronic ordering with the ingredients lists being automatically sent through to the catering supplier.

Many suppliers of fitted kitchens use computer systems to design and verify the customers requirement.  Once the sale is agreed there is obviously the potential go forward the requirement electronically to the supplier who in turn may use EDI to shorten their production lead times.

As well as bookshops you may wish to checkout a range of other products and services that can be bought online.  Examples of such facilities include: insurance, travel tickets, groceries, football clubs.  Look some of these, or other facilities up and and see the different styles, ways of signing up customers and approaches to specigying services or locating products on the site.

It is the responsibility of servers within the network to work out the location of the receiving computer and an appropriate routing to that computer.  The packets may pass through a number of network nodes on their way to the receiving computer and each packet, in theory at least, may take a different route.

The packet when it gets to the receiving computer is integrity checked and if corrupted a message is despatched to the sending computer to ask for the packet to be re-sent.  The packets within a message are reassembled using the sequence number and any missing packets will be the subject of a re-send request.  If / when the message is complete that can be acknowledged to the sending computer.

The packet switching network can be used by many client computer systems that send and receive messages - the Internet is the prime example of such a network.  Without packet switching a message exchange between two computers requires a line to be established between the sending and receiving computer (as when a voice telephone call is dialled up between two people).  With packet switching the network can be shared with many packets being routed from differing sources and destinations through the one network.

An extranet might be used for teaching material.  This restricts access to staff and students in the department but allows the students to access the site for their own home computers (there is a case for making teaching material available on the Internet but many Universities restrict access to their own students).

A work place might have a similar hierarchy of provision and access.  There is information that the company would want to make available to any interested party (publicity), further information that is available to only customers and clients and yet other material that would be restricted to employees (or selected employees).

The Internet is both a personal and a business tool with e-Commerce, arguably, bridging the two.  Businesses have been extensive users of networks from well before the popularisation of the Internet and they now use both private networks and the Internet.  Private networks are used within business premises (the LAN) and between geographically separate locations and in established inter business relationships where speed and security are important.  The Internet is used for less established links and where price is a more important factor but, as services improve, its use is becoming more widespread.

Home delivery can be a great help for someone who can not or does not like carting goods home but it is a total pain if the goods are bulky or perishable and you are not likely to be around when they arrive.

The possibly of payment fraud is always a problem but for some the threat prevents them from shopping online but others have decided to ignore the issue and deal with the consequences, if and when they arise.

There are lots of people who like doing their grocery shopping online - possibly they are both busy and organised - too busy to fit in the shopping but yet organised enough to know what will be required days in advance and to know when they will be available at home to take delivery.  Many of the rest of us are not that organised, like to select our own produce or (possibly) enjoy the trip to the supermarket.

This is the chance to plan to get seriously rich, quickly - win a Porche and a penthouse!  The requirement is to plan an e-Commerce enterprise - the first step on the way to becoming a .com millionaire.

Your findings are to be presented in the form of a business plan - the sort of document you might present to your bank manager (although it is appreciated that you probably will not be in a position to include realistic costings).

And if you want to produce a socially useful site and remain seriously poor then that is also OK.  Note the Porche and the penthouse are not given with the feedback from this assignment - you have to set up your own business to (possibly) get your hands on them.

Software that will provide interaction between the web pages and the server (setting up such interactivity is seen as beyond the scope of the system but if server side interfaces can be specified and provided this would add to the value of the assignment.

Student speakers included Shaun Priesgen, a senior geography major from Fond du Lac and chair of the University Center committee; Natalie Hagberg, a junior majoring in broad field social studies from Eagan, Minn., and chair of the UWRF leadership and programming board; Matthew Moyer, a senior environmental science major from Osseo and chair of the Earth Consciousness Organization; and Joseph Eggers, a junior political science major from Appleton and president of the UWRF Student Senate.

"As I was able to watch the construction of the building progress, and as I learned more and more about the ... University Center, I realized that my imagined vision was nothing compared to what was emerging from the wood and wires," said Hagberg. "I knew this building was going to open many doors for our campus."

Jill Druckman, a representative from the University of Minnesota Raptor Center, closed the ribbon-cutting festivities with a presentation on the Peregrine falcon, for which the UWRF athletic teams are nicknamed. She brought along a female falcon.

JAN. 29, 2007--At a time where the current generation of young people might be criticized for apathy towards civic engagement, two UWRF students are setting the bar higher as part of a program designed to help produce the next generation of civic leaders.

The program started about three or four years ago, but it has gotten more university's emphasis on civic engagement," says Linda Jacobson, campus compact campus liaison and program manager for outreach and graduate studies. "The fellows really benefit from networking with other students throughout the Upper Midwest and the leadership training that the institute offers. They also gain ideas on leadership and coalition building and an understanding of resources to support initiatives, and then come away with an action plan of what they want to do at their home institutions."

"Ms. Barnett is an outstanding individual who is not only a good student, but she has on several occasions made significant community contributions," Potts said. "When opportunities to volunteer leadership are presented to her she always steps forward."

Barnett said that working with the elderly has been a passion since high school when she was in the National Honor Society. Working with Amanda Moeller, an AmeriCorps Vista professional on campus, Barnett has founded a local program for helping the elderly in connection with St. Croix Aging Center.

"I never realized how many students were so influential in all of their campuses," Lazarre said. "There were many great ideas generated and all that you need to get going is a passion for something great and the drive to see it all the way through."

A highlight of the summit was the announcement of a "Buy Local, Buy Wisconsin" legislative initiative, which would provide statewide support including technical assistance and grants. This proposal supports local grassroots efforts to increase consumption of Wisconsin-produced agriculture products.

Halweil noted that Wisconsin is a leader in local food innovations with a large and growing number of farmers' markets and community supported agriculture (CSA) farms. Building on these successes, a number of initiatives around the state are attempting to expand local food markets by increasing institutional purchasing of Wisconsin grown products.

Jan. 29, 2007--Summer for many college students might include a full-time job and time to recharge their batteries after a year of hard work in the classroom. For one University of Wisconsin-River Falls student, summer was a time to experience the ins-and-outs of the world's leading aircraft manufacturer and a chance to ponder the wings on which to forge her future career.

Maggie Huppert, a senior business administration major from River Falls, interned this past summer in Seattle, Wash., with Boeing's customer relations department. As part of her position with customer relations she helped to plan and coordinate events ranging from marketing events and aircraft shows to a local golf tournament.

Among the events she had a hand in coordinating was the Greater Seattle Golf Classic, a tournament including participants ranging from regional business leaders to National Football League players from the Seattle Seahawks, as well as the Farnborough Air Show. Huppert's department coordinated where participants would stay as well as the events they would attend.

As part of her duties planning the marketing events, Huppert worked with the Boeing gift store to come up with appropriate gifts for buyers. This task required understanding various cultures from other parts of the world and what gifts they consider appropriate. Gifts were valued from $1 promotional items all the way up to $1 million sculptures.

Huppert said there were a lot of perks involved in her internship at Boeing, including working with the head salespeople from each region of the world, spending some time on the Boeing yacht, and catching a Seattle Mariners baseball game from the Boeing suite at Safeco Field. For other events, Huppert arranged the use of the Boeing suite at Safeco Field, as well as the catering for the various guests in the suite.

Huppert was also responsible for intern events such as luncheons, presentations, tours, and transportation. She also coordinated an etiquette conference for the interns, and attended three-hour weekly classes with the other interns.

Huppert said she had an opportunity to stay on with Boeing full time right after graduation but chose not to, citing the difficulty of being that far away from family and friends. She said she would, however, consider Boeing as a possible future option down the road.

"I had such a good experience, so I would look at it again," Huppert said. "Boeing's offices in Chicago would work better as they are closer to home, but Chicago doesn't have many entry-level positions."

Dean Olsen  and Jerry Nechville, both professors in the agricultural engineering department, traveled to Managua, Nicaragua this past summer. The pair worked with the agricultural engineering faculty at National Agrarian University (UNA) to design and incorporate more hands-on lab activities that would allow students to actually practice the skills they study.

"Currently, their program is mostly theoretical, with virtually no skills to apply the theory in the real world," said Olsen. "Students know how to design an irrigation system on paper, but have no idea how to implement these designs in the field."

The pair has been working with UNA to incorporate low-cost, hands-on class exercises in order to fully develop their engineering curriculum. Their visit coincided with a time when students started a riot against the mass transit system, which consists of old school buses. The students were upset because bus fare was to increase by 50 centavos (3 cents), which is a large amount to students whose semester tuition is only $25, said Olsen, who noted that the riot turned somewhat violent as students burned a bus, and police fired rubber bullets into the crowd.

Professor Kelly Cain, of the plant and earth science department, spent most of fall semester on sabbatical in China assisting Wong How Man, president of the China Exploration & Research Society (CERS) in their efforts to protect the culture and biodiversity at their project sites.

One mission of the CERS is to identify, design, and implement important conservation projects in remote areas of China. Cain's project is focused on the small 64-family village of Gongbing, which is adjacent to the Napahai Wetland Reserve, one of the last two remaining wintering grounds for the endangered black-necked crane.

"We are trying to help some Tibetan and Lisu villages benefit from the economic revenues being generated in the southern Tibetan Plateau region," said Cain, "while also drawing a line in the sand about their conscious limits of acceptable change in cultural tradition and environmental integrity."

Ranee May, a faculty associate in the department of animal and food science, visited China for the third time to continue her work with local Tibetans who are producing yak milk cheese in their factory. At this visit May worked with three Harvard University graduates on helping the plant with marketing plans and has helped them initiate the development of a second type of cheese to sell, which recently debuted at the Beijing Cheese Festival. May said she might return when and if the factory needs more assistance.

Two types of cheese are now available at the plant: Halloumi, a white cheese with distinctive layered texture similar to mozzarella, which is made without using a bacterial starter culture; and Asiago, which is made using a bacterial starter culture and can be have different textures, from smooth when fresh to a crumbly texture if aged. The flavor is reminiscent of sharp Cheddar and Parmesan, says May.

Along with Chancellor Don Betz  and a group of UWRF faculty and staff including CAFES Associate Dean Bob Baker  traveled early last summer on a multi-country visit to foster new exchange programs and reaffirm existing ones with Pacific Rim educational institutions. In addition CAFES Dean Dale Galenberg  traveled with Betz and other UWRF administrators to India this fall to explore new exchange programs with colleges and universities in that country.

Gregg Hadley, a professor of agricultural economics, received a grant about a year ago from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has partnered UWRF with ITA-25, an agricultural university in Mexico, to help rural Mexican colleges to further develop their faculty's knowledge in subjects that will help improve their rural economies. Two faculty members from ITA-25 finished a semester exchange at UWRF earlier this fall and others will be coming in January to spend spring semester on campus. Hadley leaves for Mexico in January, taking a few students with him.

For the past six years, David Trechter, a professor of agricultural economics, has been invited by the Deutsche Landwirtschafts Gesellschaft (DLG) to present a two-day workshop in Germany. The DLG is a German farm organization that offers a year-long agribusiness trainee program, which includes several workshops and three internships with agribusinesses at different levels of the agricultural supply chain.

At the conference, Trechter spoke about global supply and demand conditions in agriculture, supply chain management issues, U.S. agricultural policy, and entrepreneurship. Trechter said he was invited "both for the substance of the workshops and because they want their trainees to have to work and think in English." He plans to return to Germany in May.

Brenda Boetel, a professor within the agricultural economics department, is planning to venture off to Argentina and Uruguay next March. She will be traveling with extension specialists from multiple states touring livestock facilities and packing plants in both countries. "Argentina and Uruguay are both large producers of beef and are becoming big competitors for the U.S. beef industry," said Boetel. This will be her first time working with extension departments abroad.

Retired CAFES faculty members also are staying involved in international pursuits.  Professor Emeritus Jerry Nolte, retired from the agricultural economics department, continues his consistent travels and international agricultural service and is currently recruiting Lou Greub, agronomy professor emeritus and Dewey Wachholz , another retired professor from the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Science (CAFES), to go to Paraguay with him next spring.

On Thursday, March 8 at 8 p.m.  noted animal activist Dr. Temple Grandin will speak in the North Hall Auditorium. Being one of the most celebrated and effective animal advocates on the planet, Grandin will share her 30 years of professional training as an animal scientist and her understanding of the animal brain. As a person with an autism spectrum disorder, she will share her unique perspective on autism, calling it a "way station on the road from animals to humans." Grandin will support her ides through an exploration and discussion of animal feelings, aggressions, pain and suffering, as well as the animal genius. Her book, Animals in Translation , will be available for purchase at the lecture.

On Wednesday, April 25 at 10 a.m.,  the day-long outdoor festival entitled Unity in the Community will begin. It will take place in the University Center Mall and be a celebration of diversity on the UWRF campus as well as other cultures in the United State and throughout the world. There will be cultural dance performances as well as a sampling of a ethnic foods available for purchase.

On Wednesday, April 25 at 8 p.m.  the award-winning documentary, Journey to a Hate Free Millennium, will be shown in the North Hall Auditorium. This film explores a solution to the hate crimes that have become frequent events in our daily lives. The film centers around the horrific hate crimes in recent years and explores the problems and solutions with great detail and understanding. Those who attend are welcome to take a stand against hate and create their own vision of a hate-free world.

Hosted by the UW-River Falls art department, the exhibit features the best work of more than 20 western Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota students. For most of the artists, this is their first opportunity for public exhibition of their work. Students are also invited to participate in a workshop day on Feb. 2, highlighting the UWRF art department and programs.

The course covers all the entrepreneurial essentials from marketing to financial planning and budgets, to financial statements and identifying opportunities. At the conclusion of the course, students will have a completed business plan.

The Small Business Development Center also offers free confidential counseling sessions for persons interested in starting a business, expanding their business or needing assistance with business-related issues.

A wacky quintet of singer/musicians gather daily in her parlor, turn on the transmitter, and set hearts thumping and toes tapping with songs, homely chatter and plugs for a rejuvenating tonic that owes its kick to the still out back.

Implementation of change in class times. At the end of Fall Semester, the Faculty Senate approved a change in class times for the University. The timing of the implementation of the change was left to the Registrar's Office. Discussion with the Registrar's Office began at the same time the proposal was brought to Faculty Senate meaning that the Registrar's Office has dealt with and feels comfortable with the changes in class times. In consultation with the Registrar's Office, implementation of the new class times will occur Fall Semester, 2007. Monday, Wednesday, Friday classes (MWF) will be 50 minutes with 10 minutes between classes. Tuesday, Thursday classes (TR) will be 75 minutes with 15 minutes between classes. Special periods will be available for activities such as laboratory and practice sessions. Requests for special class times should be addressed to the Registrar's Office. Questions should be addressed to the Office of the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at ext. 3700.

Tours of the building are available throughout the day. For more information on grand opening events, visit http://www.uwrf.edu/pa/fd/UC GrandOpeningEvents.pdf.

Special efforts will be made to accommodate persons with disabilities. Please note that we have added to our facilities and buildings, including sidewalks, streets and parking spaces. We have not, however, increased the resources available for winter maintenance. This will result in lower priority areas not being cleared of snow and ice in as timely a manner. If a major winter storm should occur on a holiday when the campus is officially closed, only emergency vehicle access and the main entry walks of occupied residence halls are cleared. If you have suggestions or experience problems, contact manville.q.kenney@uwrf.edu or call ext. 3827.

Falcon spirit wear. The athletic department has Falcon athletics t-shirts for $5 and sweatshirts with the embroidered UWRF and Falcon head for $20 for any faculty/staff needing "Falcon Spirit" wear. E-mail  rick.h.bowen@uwrf.edu with order and size.

Important tax information. Students, staff and all tax filers: The Wisconsin Department of Revenue wants to alert people to the dangers of tax refund anticipation loans. These are high cost loans that allow a taxpayer to receive his or her tax refund in the form of a loan a few days faster than waiting for their refund check from the IRS. The typical fee of $250 is equivalent to an APR of 521 percent! Low income individuals and students are frequent targets. In an attempt to offer a no-cost alternative, the state has set up Volunteer Tax Assistance Sites. At these sites, you can file your taxes electronically and, with direct deposit, receive your tax refund in one to two weeks. Libraries distributing 2006 tax forms have information on the Tax Assistance Sites. In addition, look for information on Wisconsin income tax credits to ensure your refund is as large as it can be. Contact Kathy Schultz at ext. 3502.

The University is the western-most institution of the 26-campus University of Wisconsin System. Increasingly, it is being called upon to meet the educational needs of the expanding Twin Cities Metropolitan area that includes River Falls.

The city of River Falls is home to thirteen parks, is twelve miles from the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Croix Rivers, and is ten miles from a ski area. Between Minnesota and Wisconsin in a picturesque valley is the Lower St. Croix National Scenic Way River which flows between bluffs of limestone and sandstone. Historic river towns dot its banks, and fishing, swimming, canoeing, sailing, and boating are common. Winter brings downhill and cross-country skiing, snowboarding, ice fishing, snow-shoeing, and hiking at six state parks and three ski areas. For fourteen years the campus has been the summer training camp of the Kansas City Chiefs.

It would be accurate to say of this campus that "a river runs through it." Situated on 226 acres of rolling land, the main campus of the University of Wisconsin - River Falls features 26 major buildings and a spacious interior campus mall. The South Fork of the Kinnickinnic River (a class II trout stream) provides a pleasant natural area linking the main campus with the Ramer Athletic Complex. The campus has some unique features, such as the largest vertical sundial in North America and a new meditation garden donated by an alumnus.

The University of Wisconsin-River Falls was founded in 1874 as the fourth State Normal School in Wisconsin and the first in the northwestern part of the state. The University continues to carry out its original mission - to educate and prepare citizens for the future. Its first building was dedicated on September 2, 1875. The school experienced a slow but steady growth in curriculum and enrollment until 1912, when the Department of Agriculture was established and enrollment increased significantly. The addition of a four-year curriculum in 1926 preceded the change of all state normal schools to state teacher colleges in 1927. In 1951, with the addition of liberal arts courses, the school was designated Wisconsin State College at River Falls. When graduate courses were added in 1964 the name became Wisconsin State University-River Falls. The present name came with the merger of the state universities and the prestigious University of Wisconsin System in 1971. With the founding of the College of Business and Economics in 2001, the University now has four colleges, including the College of Arts and Sciences; the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences; and the College of Education and Professional Studies.

Idea,” which holds that “the boundaries of the campus are the boundaries of the state.” Formed in the early 19th century by a U.S. senator from Wisconsin and the president of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Wisconsin Idea has become a national model for public undergraduate education.

In the spirit of the Wisconsin Idea, UWRF has worked to connect its expertise in agriculture, education, business, as well as the arts and sciences, to serve the needs of the region and the state. While it has always been committed to serving the region and state, the University of Wisconsin-River Falls has recently emerged as a leader in the economic development of the region, having hosted five regional economic summits in the last four years.

During Chancellor Betz first semester on campus in Fall, 2005, he initiated a survey of all campus and community stakeholders to identify core values, clarify the campus mission and build an institutional vision.

Based on that survey, a summary mission statement emerged: UW-River Falls' mission is to help students learn so that they are successful as productive, creative, ethical, engaged citizens and leaders with an informed global perspective.

University degrees in the arts, letters, and sciences as well as specialized professional degrees at the baccalaureate level. Graduate degrees are offered in partnership with each of the four colleges and cooperative programs with other institutions within the state, region, and world. As a border institution, the University promotes interstate cooperation.

College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences at UW-River Falls ranks among the top four colleges of agriculture in non-land grant universities in the United States. The College has a job placement rate of over 95 percent for its graduates; employers report a high degree of satisfaction with graduates, frequently citing hands-on experiences, internships, leadership abilities, and communication skills acquired at UW-River Falls. Reflecting its emphasis on experiential learning, the College has an active internship program through which students participate in high quality professional work experiences.

Among the many things of which CAFES is justifiably proud, alumni account for about 60 percent of the high school agriculture teachers in Wisconsin. CAFES faculty are active grant writers and regularly attract the most grant dollars to the University of all the colleges on campus. One of the largest departments on campus is Animal and Food Science with over 450 students, which includes about 240 with an equine emphasis. The equine program and the dairy science major are among the largest in the United States.

The College has nine faculty members with Cooperative Extension appointments, evidence of its firm commitment to providing outreach to the community and the region. For example, a Regional Development initiative is underway to provide research and education for regions, such as the St. Croix Valley, that are experiencing rapid urbanization. Key topics range from the environmental consequences of this transformation process, to finding sustainable agricultural niches, to the sociological dimensions of change.

Programs in the humanities and social sciences have distinguished themselves across the state and nationally. For example, the journalism program, which has had excellent professional placement of its graduates, is the smallest accredited program in the country. The English department is home to the Literary Magazine Review, a nationally circulated literary journal. The College has achieved national recognition for its programs in the fine arts. The oldest continuous commissioned composer program in the country has attracted such prominent composers as John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Libby Larsen to create compositions that have been performed around the world. The Art Department, with its state-of-the art facilities, has award-winning faculty who have exhibited internationally. Attesting to the excellence of the theatre program, a student in theatre won first place for costume and makeup at the 2003 and 2004 American College Theatre Festival held annually at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC an honor that rarely goes to an undergraduate.

College of Arts and Sciences provides many opportunities for student involvement. In addition to a variety of internship opportunities with companies in such fields as biotechnology, chemistry, geographic information systems (GIS), and marketing communication, the College also has an active program of undergraduate research and creative activity that is supported by a student grants process funded by alumni contributions.

The College of Arts and Sciences has collaboration with the College of Education and Professional Studies that serves as a model for the University of Wisconsin System. CAS programs are strongly committed to interacting with K-12 school systems to provide current and varied content knowledge for students and teachers as well as providing the foundation for training future teachers.

The College provides master's programs designed specifically to meet the needs of returning teachers by offering courses in summer institutes and in special settings like the Pigeon Lake Field Station. Departments sponsor a variety of activities that involve thousands of students and their teachers from this region throughout the school year including Advanced Placement Review Days, disciplinary workshops, speech and debate contests, science exploration days, and art and music events.

In recent years, the College has fulfilled its commitment to serve the community through a variety of outreach efforts that have brought the expertise of the College to meet the needs of the region. In collaboration with the Phipps Center for the Arts in Hudson, Wisconsin, the College has sponsored forums on topics of interest to the region, such as land use development or strategies for building community. The College also sponsors a community lecture series in which faculty speak at the local public library about topics of general interest to the community, from understanding Alzheimer’s disease to voting in a battleground state.

The College seeks to prepare future business leaders for the dynamic and fast-changing business environment ahead. The College values high quality teaching combined with a high level of student/faculty interaction. The College and its faculty are continually striving to create excellence in the business student’s learning environment. An Alumni Advisory Board and a Business Advisory Board work with the Dean and faculty of the College in offering programs that integrate the business classroom and the business community. Outreach activities of the College are of two types: professional training programs for business professionals, and service training for the small - to medium - sized businesses of the surrounding area. The College and its staff are actively involved in the economic development activities of the region. Faculty of the College regularly receive recognition for their excellence in areas such as teaching and community service. During the academic year 2003-2004, a CBE faculty member was named one of two Outstanding Teachers in the UW System, a Economics Department faculty member was UW-River Falls 2005 Distinguished Teacher, and another was named a UW System Wisconsin Idea Fellow (outstanding service in economic development).

The College is noted for its award-winning Elementary Education program, its preparation of teachers and others in the area of educational technology, and its strong partnerships with practitioners. The Technology Leadership Cadre of undergraduate and graduate students assists teachers and fellow students in mastering technology. A PK16 Partnership allows the College to collaborate with school districts in multiple ways, including shared, grant-funded in-service programs. Other partnerships include those with schools in St. Paul and Stillwater, Minnesota, with many social service agencies and health care facilities, and with a group of remote districts in Northern Wisconsin, served through a federally-funded distance grant. The Western Wisconsin Partnership brings in nearly $1 million per year in federal funds to train child abuse prevention workers in 25 counties and 5 Indian tribes.

Graduate Studies Office at UW-River Falls, in collaboration with the academic colleges, offers selected graduate degree and certificate programs in a variety of formats designed to meet the needs of specific audiences. These include summer workshop programs, evening and weekend courses and online options.

The Master of Science in Education (MSE) is offered for certified secondary teachers, for those seeking initial certification in Elementary Education and in Reading. Both the MSE and MS are offered in Counseling and the MSE and an Education Specialist degree are offered in School Psychology. The MSE-Professional Development provides an opportunity to create new and innovative degree programs such as the Shared Inquiry Community and the Principal Licensure Program. The MS in Agricultural Education is offered in options designed for certified teachers, for those seeking certification and in Sustainable Community Development. The College of Business and Economics offers a Master of Management degree.

An increasing number of certificate programs provide professional development for educators and others. These include certificates in Community Education, Service Learning, Technology for Teachers and Wildlife, Recreation and nature Tourism. In some cases, courses in a certificate program can be applied to a subsequent graduate degree.

The Outreach office offers credit programs at both the graduate and undergraduate level, a variety of noncredit programs including those for youth and seniors, manages the University Summer Session and January Term, the Pigeon Lake Field Station, and the Survey Research Center. All credit generating outreach programs are coordinated with and approved by the relevant colleges, using Program Managers as liaisons between the Colleges and the Outreach office. Outreach is primarily a full cost recovery unit, which contributes overhead to UW-RF and shares substantial end-of-year carry forward funds with the Colleges based on level of activity and success. The Outreach office offers a large credit portfolio primarily for educators and a number of online programs. The Outreach office’s numerous UW-RF internal partners are critically important to its successes, and it has partnerships with sister UW campuses, technical colleges, a variety of nonprofit organizations and communities in and around the St. Croix River Valley.

A new and unique international program is UW-RF’s International Traveling Classroom. Students spend a semester in Europe, traveling and earning credits in course units taught by UW-RF faculty members situated in different locations.

The students move to that location for the duration of the unit, e.g., the group may spend 3-4 weeks in London studying British theatre and then travel to Germany for a 3-4 week course in European history.

Diversity. River Falls developed several initiatives in the areas of increasing enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of students of color; increasing diversity of faculty, academic staff, classified staff, and administrators of color; and supporting a learning environment and course development that demonstrate respect for racial and ethnic diversity.

Maximum enrollment for each University of Wisconsin System institution is determined by UW System Administration in consultation with the administration and faculty at each campus. At UWRF, the head count enrollment is currently set at approximately 6000 students - about 300-400 of whom are graduate students and the rest undergraduates.

The majority of the University's students come from Wisconsin; however, given its unique location, it is not surprising that there is a large population of students from Minnesota . A number of other states and foreign countries are also represented in the student body. About 60% of the University's overall enrollment are women.

The Dean for Student Development and Campus Diversity (housed in the Dean of Students Office) is responsible for supervising university programs and services vital to students' personal success. The Dean of Students Office serves as a clearinghouse for students, parents, and faculty seeking information and assistance related to student concerns. Designated by the Chancellor, the Dean also serves as the university's principle officer in matters of student discipline and coordinates the institutional crisis response plan.

Development programs are organized into two centers which provide a variety of services and support for students in their learning and personal development. These two centers are the Academic Success Center (disability support, McNair scholars, multicultural services, pre-college programs, pre-major advising, Student Support Services and tutoring) and the Personal and Professional Development Center (career, counseling and student health services).

Student Development works collaboratively with Student Services and Programs (which reports to the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance) on a variety of activities and programs such as: residence life, student organizations, student government, student conduct, as well as the orientation of new students, transfer students, and parents.

UW-RF students are characterized as industrious, bright, hard working, and involved. The division of student services and programs at UW-River Falls provides a full-service, diverse, and well-utilized array of activities, programs, and services for students. Forty professional staff and 300 student staff manage all aspects of the University’s extracurricular and student life program. Student Development includes residential living, student government, Greek life and more than 130 student organizations, and recreational and intramural sports.

Faculty take great pride in their interactions with students as teachers, academic advisers, mentors, and advisers to student clubs and organizations. The University annually recognizes a Distinguished Teacher and Outstanding Academic Advisor, while each college recognizes its own outstanding faculty. Faculty research, scholarly, and creative activity frequently involve students as co-investigators.

For three years the campus has celebrated the research, scholarly, and creative activity of faculty and staff at an annual recognition event hosted by the Chalmer-Davee Library staff. In 2006, 114 individual faculty were recognized for their achievements.

The campus provides support for faculty development, travel, and research, scholarly, and creative activity, while the UW System provides a variety of opportunities such as the Wisconsin Teaching Fellow and Wisconsin Teaching Scholar, the University of Wisconsin Extension Applied Research Grants, department chairs seminars, annual Faculty College , Women in Science workshops, and the annual UW System Women's Studies Conference. Faculty members are active grant writers, securing an average of $2.5 million dollars in extramural funds to support program and research initiatives.

The University’s budget has been increasing, but below the rate of inflation and far below the growth in state spending. Most of these increases have gone to pay fixed costs such as utility increases, debt service, and fringe benefits. University costs have risen faster than the rate of inflation, leaving the University’s budget in a squeeze.

As the central fund-raising agency for the University, the UW-River Falls Foundation supports the University’s mission through a volunteer Board of Directors dedicated to ensuring gifts are well-managed, productively invested, and used as donors have directed. The Office of University Advancement handles the daily work supporting philanthropic efforts. The Board of Directors serves without compensation, meets four times a year, attends committee meetings, and sets policies for successfully raising, managing, and prudently investing gifts that help realize the mission of the University. The Chancellor, an ex-officio member of the Board, establishes the formal channel of communication between the University and Foundation. The Executive Director for University Advancement serves as the President of the Foundation.

The Constitution of UW-River Falls designates the 21-person Faculty Senate as its legislative arm. Academic staff have been granted faculty status for governance purposes and serve on the Faculty Senate. Students do not serve on the Faculty Senate but do serve on most Senate committees. The ten-member Academic Staff Council consists of nine staff members elected through an at-large spring election and one ranked faculty member appointed by the Chancellor upon the recommendation of the Faculty Senate. The Council has responsibility for staff personnel policy and issues.

Senate. The Student Senate, comprised of 23 elected student representatives, serves as the major recommending body relative to overall campus matters, reviews and handles the complete spectrum of student-life related concerns, and confers regularly with the University administration and Faculty Senate. Its recommendations are directed to the Chancellor on most matters.

The Office of Institutional Research at UWRF facilitates and supports continuous quality improvement. It produces analytical reports to address questions about students, services and academic programs. It generates research for use in administrative decision-making related to curriculum, enrollment management, strategic planning, program evaluation, policy and emerging issues of concern to the campus community. This office also monitors the accuracy of information disseminated about the University, its students and academic programs.

TThe Parking Department, located at 27 South Hall, is a part of the Department of Public Safety at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls . The department provides parking services to students, employees, and visitors of the University. It is a self-supporting auxiliary not supported by state funding or student tuition. Parking operating, maintenance, and development expenses are funded by revenue generated from parking services.

Our goal is to provide convenient and quality parking to meet the needs of the campus, community, and visitors. The Parking Program has been established to govern available spaces. These spaces are enforced by the use of parking permits, meters and time restrictions.

Parking is only permitted within the confines of a single marked space or in a designated parking bay in a gravel lot. Parking permits are required when parking in student and faculty/staff (employee) lots as well as physically challenged areas and loading zones. Please note that specially signed areas such as the 20 minute loading zones with flashers, fire lanes, physically challenged, state vehicle parking spaces and any other restricted spaces are enforced 24 hours per day. Parking is always prohibited on sidewalks, grassy areas, fire lanes and where curbs are painted yellow.

The responsibility of finding a legal parking space rests with the vehicle operator. A parking permit does not ensure the availability of a parking space, but grants the authorization to park in specified areas when space is available. If the lot for which you hold a permit is full, you must contact the Parking Department at (715) 425-3333 for instructions on where to park.

If you own, possess, or operate a vehicle on UWRF campus, you are responsible for being familiar with the regulations governing parking on campus. Parking on campus is at one's own risk and the Parking Department is not responsible for any lost or stolen items.

The Parking Department is authorized by Wisconsin Administrative Codes 18.05 and 18.06 to enforce parking compliance of University parking regulations. A citation will be issued to any vehicle parking in violation of published or posted parking regulations.

The Parking Department is responsible for the enforcement of parking regulations on University lands. Parking on the city streets is enforced by the River Falls Police Department. To receive information regarding city parking, refer to their website at www.rfcity.org/police .

The University reserves the right to revoke the parking privilege and/or tow and impound vehicles of chronic violators. Vehicles become tow eligible if a balance of $100 or more is accrued by a customer. Vehicles and/or customers receiving more than ten (10) citations per semester will be subject to a chronic violator citation. Chronic violator citations are $100 per violation for subsequent violations.

A citation may be appealed by completing a Parking Appeal Form request within 14 days of the citation date. Forms are available in the Parking Office, 27 South Hall or this website. Appeals are decided upon by a committee once a month during the academic year. The committee is comprised of students, faculty, and staff of the University. The decision of the Parking Committee is binding on the Parking Department and appellant.

Parking permits are the hanger type and must be displayed from the rearview mirror with permit number facing the front of the vehicle. The permit holder is responsible for properly displaying the permit. Ownership of permits remain with UWRF. Resale or transfer of permits is prohibited. Use of a permit by anyone other than the registered purchaser, as well as any fraudulent activity may result in fine, revocation, confiscation, and prosecution for theft under 943.20(1)(a), Wis. State Statutes of UWS 18.06(41).

Refunds may be obtained by contacting the Parking Department. Refund requests on or before August 31, 2006 will be assessed a $5.00 cancellation fee. Any refund request thereafter will be prorated. Refund requests are then processed through the Accounting Office and may take between four and six weeks. Refunds will not be issued unless the permit is returned to the Parking Department. If a permit is revoked, there will be no refund of the permit value. Permits are non-refundable after April 30, 2007.

The Do Not Ticket List is to accommodate those holding a valid permit who are unable to find a space in their assigned lot. If your assigned lot is full, you may park in an alternate lot of the same type (i.e. students to a student lot, faculty/staff to a faculty/staff lot), however you MUST  contact the Parking Department at (715) 425-3333 with your name, vehicle identification and alternate lot utilized immediately. Failure to do so will result in a citation. Messages left with incomplete information will not be accepted for the Do Not Ticket List. The Do Not Ticket List is only valid until 8:00am the next day, so measures must be taken to purchase a temporary permit, or vehicles will be ticketed. If you do not hold a valid permit on campus, you may not utilize the Do Not Ticket List unless you are a visitor. Please see the Visitor section for more information.

Students living in Residential Halls have the option of purchasing a permit to park in a student permit space pending availability. University parking lots designated with overnight student permit parking are: E, K, L, N, O and W. These lots are identified with a sign at each entrance indicating student permit parking along with the name of the lot. Permits are enforced in these lots from 6:00pm Sunday until 4:30pm Friday. Display of the permit authorizes parking only in the specific permit space designated on the permit.

Student parking permits must be returned to the Parking Department if you move off campus or withdraw from school. A prorated refund will then be issued. Permits are non-refundable after April 30, 2007. Transferring a permit from one student to another is not allowed and will result in revocation of parking privileges, Improperly Obtained Permit citation and possible UWS 18.06 (44) citation. If a permit is revoked, there will be no refund of the permit value.

Commuter student permits are available through the Parking Department. These permits are valid in the commuter rows (row 8 - 11) at Ramer Field from 7:30am-4:30pm. If a commuter student chooses not to purchase a commuter permit, limited University metered parking and city street parking is available. To receive information regarding city parking, refer to the RFPD website at www.rfcity.org/police .

Display of the permit authorizes parking only in the specific lot designated on the permit. The registered permit holder is responsible for any parking violations issued to the vehicle bearing the permit. University employees are mailed applications for the upcoming academic school year in April of the current academic school year. Employee permits are assigned first by seniority status and then by office location provided the applications are received by the deadline set by the Parking Department.

Student visitor parking is available in the 8th row at Ramer Field with a valid visitor permit issued by the Parking Department. These permits are available from the Parking Department during regular business hours. If the visitor arrives after hours, they may park in the visitor area (8th row, Ramer Field), however they must call the Parking Department at (715) 425-3333 and leave their name and vehicle information on the Do Not Ticket List. Failure to do so will result in a citation. Messages left with incomplete information will not be accepted for the Do Not Ticket List. The Do Not Ticket List is only valid until 8:00am the next day, so measures must be taken to purchase a temporary permit, or vehicles will be cited. Visitors to residence hall students are not allowed to park in the regular student permit spaces during hours of enforcement, which are 6:00pm Sunday - 4:30pm Friday.

Spaces for use by the physically challenged are identified in selected lots by Physically Challenged Parking signs. Spaces are designated in lots A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, O, P, Q, QM, R, S, T, U, W and on the East Service Road. Vehicles must display a state issued physically challenged authorization or a Temporary University permit when using these spaces. Any physically challenged permit that is hanger type must be displayed from the rear view mirror. Enforcement of these spaces is 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. Motor vehicles parked in areas designated for the physically challenged without proper plates or permits may be cited and towed at the owner's expense. A physically challenged parking permit is only valid in physically challenged spaces or in the meters, provided the meter is one hour or greater, without paying the meter fee. Temporary Physically Challenged Parking Permits are available in the Parking Department by submitting a letter from a physician outlining the necessity and duration of the permit requirement. Temporary University Physically Challenged Permits will be issued for a maximum of 4 weeks. Physically Challenged permits are not valid in regular parking spaces within faculty/staff or student lots. Physically Challenged overnight parking November 1 through April 1 is not allowed on frontage roads. East Residence Halls should utilize designated spaces in T and O lots November 1 through April 1.

Motorcycles must park in designated motorcycle stalls (located in A, E, F, G, O and Q lots). If all motorcycle stalls are full, please contact the Parking Department for instructions on where to park. Mopeds and motor scooters (under 50cc engine) may be parked in bicycle racks on campus, provided they are within the confines of the actual bike rack. Parking such vehicles on sidewalks, curbs, etc. next to the bike rack will be subject to a citation. Such vehicles may not operate under power between the roadway and bicycle racks. Operation off roadways could result in a fine of up to a $249.00 citation and impoundment. A permit is not required for motorcycle parking.

Vehicles left on University property without proper registration or a valid permit for more than ten days will be considered abandoned and will be towed and impounded at the owner's expense. If the vehicle is not claimed within thirty days of the letter sent out by local towing companies, the towing service will begin proceedings to dispose of the vehicle. When these proceedings have been completed, the University shall be absolved of all rights/responsibilities to the vehicle and the vehicle shall become the property of the towing service.

The UWRF snow removal policy is in effect from November 1st through March 31st each year. Faculty/Staff lots and service roads will be plowed first, followed by the main aisles in student lots. These actions are necessary to attempt to preserve access for emergency vehicles. Vehicles parked illegally in these areas will be towed at the owner's expense. If excessive snow exists in Faculty/Staff lots making parking impossible, contact the Parking Department for alternatives.

When it is necessary to plow student lots completely, students will be notified prior to the plowing date. Notices will be posted on the parking information boards in each residence hall, which are located by exit doors leading to the parking lots. It is the responsibility of the students to check the parking boards in the residence halls. Any vehicles remaining in student lots after the deadline will be issued a citation and towed at the owner's expense. Authorized alternate parking accommodations will be made and communicated to the campus community. In the event authorized alternate parking is full, it is the responsibility of the permit holder to find a legal parking space.

N lot is located in a floodplain and is subject to flooding. This situation will normally occur only when there is a great deal of rain in a short period of time or a fast snowmelt in the spring. The Public Safety Department will notify the residential hall staff via the emergency alert system when these weather conditions occur. It is the responsibility of the vehicle operator to be aware of these weather conditions and to be prepared to move their vehicle if severe conditions should occur. Vehicles should be removed from N lot and parked at Ramer in the commuter rows (rows 8 - 11) unless otherwise directed by the Parking Department. The Public Safety and Parking Departments are not responsible for any vehicles that are damaged due to failure to remove a vehicle. The Public Safety and Parking departments reserve the right to tow any vehicle (at the owner's expense) left in N lot should a flood occur.

If a vehicle breaks down, severe weather conditions exist, or a personal emergency prevents you from moving your vehicle, contact the Parking Department (715) 425-3333 during regular business hours or a Public Safety Officer (715) 425-3133 after hours.

Why I decided to attend UW-River Falls : The location of the campus is perfect. If you want to have a quiet night you can stay in River Falls and just hang out with some friends. Also, if you want to have a full night of entertainment, the Twin Cities are just 30 minutes away.

Campus Involvement: I am involved with Vespers. Vespers is a Praise and Worship Religious fellowship on campus. I am a resident assistant. I live in the halls and plan programs to have everybody feel like they contribute to the campus and feel comfortable at the University.

Favorite professor: I enjoy Coach Cindy Hovet. She has a way of teaching like no other professor. She is able to keep my attention all class period long and she has tactics that enhance my learning and are easy to remember.

Favorite spot on campus: Knowles. When students are in Knowles they are all serving one purpose. Either to enjoy a hockey game or to have fun with Intramurals. It is my favorite spot on campus because I connect with all of the students who have the same interests as me.

Favorite event on campus: Hockey Game. You just know that everybody on a Friday night is going to be watching the game. The fans are loud and proud and you just get to meet up with all of your friends and enjoy a good night.

Best reason to live on/off campus: The best reason to live on campus is because you make all of the connections with people that you don't have to chance to when living off campus. You meet all of your friends, and get involved with so much that there is no way you can get all of that off campus.

Best thing about being a student at UW-River Falls : The best thing about being a student at UWRF is that the professors take the time to know you on a first name basis and they enjoy having you in class. You are more to them than just a number.

If I could give one piece of advice to incoming students it would be: Come into college with an open mind. There will be so many different people with a variety of opinions that you will grow and learn in more ways that you could imagine.

You have several options when scheduling your campus visit. You can arrange a weekly tour and information session or attend one of our Visit Days, which are special programs that give you a closer look at the university.

Those surveyed were asked to describe our campus, offer what its core values should be in the 21st Century, describe their vision for the institution, offer an opinion on its strengths, suggest its future defining characteristics, offer what changes will be needed to accomplish those characteristics, and weigh in on how Chancellor Don Betz should be spending his time.

Glowing and hopeful comments were offered by many of the respondents. Among them was a response to the core values question that summarized, "UW-RF should be an ethical, knowledgeable, congenial, affordable educational institution that operates with the greatest integrity to meet the educational needs of its students."

A student offered this commentary about institutional strengths: "I have had 16 professors since I've been enrolled as a student here. These instructors have all been exceptional in my opinion. Each one of them has been inspiring, helpful, and thought provoking....If that is not what is most important in education, I don't know what else it could be."

The survey information will next be used as UW-RF moves forward in a strategic planning process that Chancellor Betz pledges will be of short duration to insure timely implementation with specific action steps to realize the vision outlined in the survey.

Tuition and fees are due by the 10th day of the term to avoid all finance charges. A 1% finance charge will be assessed every 30 days on unpaid balances including anticipated aid that has not been credited to your account. You will not be able to register for the next term until all fees are paid in full and a minimum $100 registration down payment for the next term is posted to your account.

A monthly billing statement showing the previous balance and subsequent activity will be sent to your billing or email address every 30 days. You can verify and/or change your address using eSIS. Students not making their own payments must forward bills to their parents or payment sources. It is the students' responsibility to furnish the University with current addresses. Non-receipt of monthly statements does not excuse non-payment by the due dates.

The Agricultural Business Major is designed to combine educational elements of technical agriculture, business, and economics. It is a strong major for students who plan on working in farming or agribusiness where business and management skills are important. This major will help you develop skills needed for both entry level positions and for advancement in your chosen profession. This major does not prepare you for a specific job; it prepares you to effectively learn the specifics of a broad array of business related jobs found throughout the agricultural sector.

Students majoring in Agricultural Engineering Technology are provided with educational opportunities which combine an understanding of the biological, physical and agricultural sciences, with the problem solving skills of an engineer. Application of technical knowledge is emphasized as opposed to analytical and design aspects stressed in a professional engineering curriculum. Engineering technologists play an important role in the implementation of technical knowledge in a changing world.

The on-going challenges and opportunities related to food, soil and crop sciences, production agriculture, agricultural education, geo-sciences, natural resources and  environmental sciences on  regional, national and global scales create a broad range of exciting career opportunities.

Additional special areas of emphasis include dairy science, horse science, meat animal science, agricultural business, horticulture, crop science, agricultural engineering technology, soil science, environmental science and management, land use planning, conservation and geology.

The Office of University Advancement invites you to let us know what is happening in your life. The information you provide may appear in the next Falcon Features alumni magazine or in its online version.

Anthropology is the study of human variation. Classic anthropology focuses on cultural diversity, the interpretation of cultural remains (archaeology), and human evolution. Current interests in anthropology are more in applied fields and include salvage archaeology, forensic science and criminology, health care and medicine, civil and native rights advocacy, business management, and public administration.

The minor increases a student's awareness of what it means to be human: the range of humanity is revealed. We live in a society, in a world which is multi-ethnic, multi-racial, multi-cultural. A student who is skilled at understanding the causes and consequences of human differences will be more successful at living and working in this world. Currently, anthropology minors are majoring in biology, education, english, geography, geology, history, music, plant science, psychology and sociology.

The anthropology minor is structured to provide a solid understanding of the relationship between culture and behavior. Students will learn about many cultural traditions: some ancient, some modern. Humans are studied as both social and biological actors. Cultural traditions are shown to define the conditions of life: how people make children, nourish them, instruct them, protect them from harm, and reward them. Culture is renewed with each generation.

World-wide, Shotokan is the most practiced style of traditional karate. The reason for this popularity is obvious to anyone who takes a close look at the art. The tremendous power generated by the techniques of Shotokan make for very effective self-defense. The degree of effort and control necessary to generate that force also makes Shotokan one of the best forms of exercise available.

The Chancellor’s Award recognizes students who possess the qualities of leadership, service and commitment and acknowledges a student’s unique personal traits and skills.

Mission Statement The mission of the Biotechnology Program at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls is to provide its students with an education that establishes a strong foundation and appreciation for understanding developments in the rapidly advancing field of biotechnology, to develop the technical and critical thinking skills necessary for success in the field, to foster ethical behavior, and to promote outreach.

The field of modern biotechnology was born of molecular biology and biochemistry. Modern Biotechnology provides a set of tools that allow scientists to modify and harness the genetic capabilities of organisms. This has led to rapid advances in many areas including pharmaceutical development, agriculture, food microbiology, medical devices and environmental sciences.

Some examples of the products of biotechnology include herbicide, drought and insect resistant crops, drugs targeted specifically to disease processes resulting in fewer side effects, and bioremediation capable of removing greater amounts of environmental toxins at reduced cost.

The Biotechnology major at UW-RF is an interdepartmental program with an emphasis on the molecular basis of life and the techniques utilized to study and control these processes under in vivo, in vitro, and commercial production conditions. The Biotechnology curriculum is an integrated sequence of courses selected from the curricula of the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Animal and Food Science, and Plant and Earth Science. It includes both traditional offerings of the departments involved and courses that reflect advances in biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology. The Biotechnology major is designed to provide students interested in pursuing careers in this rapidly expanding field with the academic background required to either secure entry level positions in industry or to continue their education in graduate or professional schools. A student may complete a B.S. degree in Biotechnology in the College of Arts and Sciences or the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences.

Concerts/clinics include demonstrations, question and answer time, and discussions ranging from practice techniques to the role of each instrument in the ensemble. Other issues covered may include playing as a section, proper volume, intonation, etc. Clinics can be organized to address topics relevant to your ensemble. In addition, River Falls Brass rehearses individual brass sections and coaches small ensembles.

The UW-River Falls campus environmental audit will help create a more informed campus that is better able to implement environmentally friendly policies and practices. The intent of this audit is to provide resource consumption data and use it to educate student, faculty and staff about how they can make changes that will lead UW-River Falls down the road toward environmental sustainability and sustainable development. Being a pioneer in the University of Wisconsin system, UW-River Falls is the first university with a functional auditing system.

Shows resource usage from 1994-present in the areas of recycling, electricity, and water consumption. This section will be updated annually to better inform students and faculty about the campuses path toward being environmentally sustainable and provide a means to determine whether resource conservation measures are successful.

Provides the full report on the purpose of the project, the methodology for data collection, recommendations for future audits, analysis of the data, and a discussion and conclusion about what I learned while conducting this audit.

This section is for anyone with comments regarding making the campus more sustainable. Anyone who wants to request information or voice a concern about campus sustainability is welcome to do so. Please send all responses to Dr. Kelly Cain, Plant and Earth Science Department.

Questions asked to gain needed information to provide the necessary benchmarks for the campus to gear its progress toward environmental sustainability for years to come. This form will be sent annually to applicable campus faculty to obtain the previous years data. The data will be added to existing resource consumption charts or new charts will be created.

This section will answer some common questions people have when looking at an environmental audit. Such as, what is environmental sustainability, why should I be concerned, and what can individuals do to help.

Kansas City's 2007 training camp on the River Falls campus will mark the 17th consecutive year the Chiefs have conducted their preseason work in Western Wisconsin. The team has three remaining one-year options in its existing agreement with UW-RF should the Chiefs wish to exercise them.

"On behalf of the entire Chiefs organization, we're delighted to return to the University of Wisconsin - River Falls for a 17th consecutive year," Peterson commented. "We have enjoyed our relationship with UW-River Falls and look forward to continuing that partnership for another year. I want to personally thank the entire River Falls community and particularly the staff at UW-River Falls for making training camp so productive for us the past 16 years. They have never become complacent and have worked diligently to improve each year."

"We're very pleased that the Kansas City Chiefs will be returning to UW-River Falls for a 17th year next summer," UW-River Falls Chancellor Don Betz commented. "This has been a positive relationship for the Chiefs, the University and the St. Croix Valley of Wisconsin. Having the Chiefs on our campus each year is an event that everyone looks forward to with anticipation. We again welcome the opportunity to be the first step of our favorite NFL team's journey to a successful football season."

Thanks to a $2.4 million dollar funding package from the State of Wisconsin and UWRF students, the University made a number of improvements to Knowles Arena on the University of Wisconsin-River Falls campus, which the Chiefs have enjoyed since 2005. Knowles Arena was enlarged, two new locker rooms with 100 pro-style lockers were added, while shower and dressing areas were improved. In addition, a new, 2,500 square foot training room was added and upgraded to state-of-the-art status. The entire building is air conditioned, which is an additional plus for the Chiefs.

The Kansas City Chiefs organization has provided many opportunities for students and the University since 1991 when its first summer training camp was held at UWRF. The Chiefs have opened many doors to UWRF graduates with internships, volunteer and work experiences, and relationships with Chiefs and media personnel who have served as mentors and references for students.

The Chief's presence also benefits the larger campus and community. The revenue generated directly and indirectly by this NFL organization has improved the campus physical plant, including the Pavilion at Ramer Field, the gazebo, and portions of the Knowles addition. Additional funds help support the food service and residence life budgets, which helps keep those student costs lower than many of our sister institutions. Their annual training camps have generated positive publicity for the campus and community. Accepting the award on behalf of the Kansas City Chiefs is Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Denny Thum.

The Fast Copy Center is equipped to produce printing in a rapid fashion. The Publications Office can help you determine if a printed piece can be produced in Fast Copy or if off-campus printing is necessary. Fast Copy generally produces printed material for distribution on campus to inform the campus community of events, and material used within and between departments and offices.

For quantities up to 5000, allow Fast Copy two to five days to complete the order. For requests of more than 5,000 copies please consult with the Fast Copy manager prior to submitting an order, as there may be an alternative printing source which provides a timely and more cost effective result. For cost information, contact the Fast Copy Center.

Services are offered to those campus offices or organizations using a charge-back number through the university accounting system. Student organizations without an account number may be able to use this service through arrangements with the Leadership Center. Fast Copy also accepts cash from any individual or organization not using the university accounting system. When requesting printing, please complete the order form available in the Fast Copy Center.

Fast Copy can print one or both sides of a sheet of paper up to 11" x 17". Black ink is standard, however, colored inks are printed every Monday. When requesting color printing, planning ahead is essential to ensure timely and satisfactory results. Check with Fast Copy personnel when submitting your color requests to be sure your time-frame can be met. If you are providing camera-ready copy for color printing, it must be received by Fast Copy the Friday before printing.

Available papers include 20-pound white or colored sulphite bond; 70-pound offset stock, 65-pound cover stock, adhesive back stock or 110-pound index stock. Most of these are recycled papers.

Carbonless forms up to five-part can be produced in limited quantities.

When preparing hard copy for printing in the Fast Copy Center, remember that dense black images on white paper will provide the best reproduction. Photos and other gray scale images should be halftoned to an 85 line screen. You'll be much happier with the finished job if you take the time to prepare your copy in this manner. If you are not sure how to prepare your images for printing contact the Publications office for assistance.

Welcome to UWRF Counseling Services Our mission is to assist individuals to grow and learn within an educational, developmental, and brief therapeutic framework that enables them to become more productive, responsible, and contributing members of society.

The university is a unique community whose members, especially students, have common characteristics and special needs. Counseling staff understand the issues associated with learning, personal growth, and life span development.

Counseling assists individuals in overcoming obstacles that may otherwise prevent them from attaining academic,  personal, and professional goals. Counselors utilize developmental, preventative, and consultative methods to work with students, faculty, and staff in order to foster health and success.

We hope that you find the content of this page informative and useful, whether you are  just beginning your exploration of graduate education or you are a current student. The department consists of two separate graduate level programs. The Counseling Program leads to a Masters of Science in Education (M.S.E.), while the School Psychology Program culminates with a Specialist in Education (Ed.S.). For more information on these programs, click on the program link to the left or contact one of our department faculty members listed below.

Special Course Fees are defined as charges in addition to the regular instructional fee (tuition) and segregated fees. These fees are assessed to all students enrolled in a course with an approved Special Course Fee. Special Course Fees must be used solely for support of the course involved. Difficulty in securing adequate regular budget support shall not be the determining factor in the decision to charge a Special Course Fee. Special Course Fees can only be used to cover cost of special fees related to a course. Special Course Fees cannot be used for expenditures that are unrelated to the original Special Course Fee request (i.e., capital purchases, faculty travel to workshops, etc.).

For example, class handouts is not adequate, specify what the handouts will be; studio supplies is not adequate, specify type of supplies; and "study tours" should show a breakdown of lodging, meals, airfare, miscellaneous, etc. Explain why there is a charge. If all students in the class will not be paying the special course fee, contact the Accounts Receivable office prior to submitting the Request for Approval of Special Course Fee Form.

All Outreach/Extension courses must be approved by the academic dean (Outreach Course Addition Form and/or Course/Instructor Appointment Form) before the course is put on the web and open for enrollment, but can be approved at any time during the term. At the same time as the course is entered on the web, but before it is opened for enrollment, the Special Course Fee Form must be completed and forwarded to the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance.

If there is ANY change from the original request, a new request must be processed (i.e., amount of fee, section #, term, component, etc.).  If changes are made to the course set up in eSIS and a new form is not submitted, the Special Course Fee will not be assessed to the students.  Special course fees will be rolled from Spring to Fall to Spring, etc. until a change is processed or the three-year renewal period expires.  Summer and J-Term special course fees do not roll over automatically.  A form is required EACH Summer and J-Term session that the fee should be charged.

Enter "All" in the section field if all sections of a course should be assessed the Special Course Fee. If the fee is NOT for  all sections of a course, please indicate the section numbers on form (i.e.,  1 & 2 - 4, 5, 6 & 7, etc.). The section number is important because the Special Course Fee Table will be rolled over automatically for future terms (unless otherwise indicated); therefore, once a Special Course Fee is approved, it will continue to be charged to all sections or the section(s) specified until a request for a change has been processed with renewals being required every three years. However, if a future term course has a different section number than on the original request, the Special Course Fee will not be charged to the students.

Sends the original to the Accounts Receivable Office for processing, who in turn will code request, update eSIS system, send information to the Registrar's Office, and send a copy of the completed form(s) back to Vice Chancellor's Office. The Registrar's Office will update the class notes with the fee amount.

It balances theoretical knowledge, including current research, with applied aspects of criminal law, law enforcement, corrections, community-based systems, administration and policy. The program attracts students from sociology, psychology, social work, parks and recreation, political science, history and education.

The mission of the Criminal Justice Program is to prepare people for productive and exciting careers in criminal justice. Students in this program learn to outline the change in thinking about crime and delinquency, identify major shifts in criminal justice knowledge, and relate that knowledge to social control strategies.

They learn to describe the typical components of the criminal justice process in the United States and explain the interactions among them. Students are guided as they evaluate theories of deviance and apply them to discussions about trends and risk factors for crime and delinquency. They assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies (past and present), begin to generate innovative solutions to criminal justice problems, and learn how to impact the future of crime prevention and criminal apprehension.

"I can say that my experiences and training were remarkable. From traveling with the Crops and Soils Club to the hands on training in the field from soil judging and courses, I loved every moment of it and feel it was the best possible training I could have received."

A Degree Audit Report (DAR) provides a record of your undergraduate academic progress toward completion of a specific degree program. The DAR reviews your UW-River Falls Course work, including in-progress courses, and all transfer coursework to evaluate the completion of the requirements for your specific degree. The DAR itemizes specific requirements and shows the steps that you have taken or need to take to complete your degree.

It is important to remember that Dars is a computer software program, not an individual. If there is incorrect information in Dars for you personally, it may be because the information in the computer is incomplete or simply inaccurate. Simple errors can easily be corrected. Errors as a result of a student not following their degree program as specified in the college catalog should be addressed with the student’s advisor.

These holds do not stop a student from registering, getting transcripts, etc. They indicate that this student's academic transcript and DAR may be inaccurate. The Registrar's Office is working on manually updating each student so that they have the correct data. If you have further questions please contact the Registrar's Office.

In some cases a course may apply to more than one requirement and will appear on your DAR more than once. However, the credits for these courses will be applied only once to the cumulative credits and GPA. Courses which have been retaken will only receive credit once.

Yes, the DAR gives you the opportunity to see how the courses that you have taken could apply to different requirements in different degree programs. We call this a 'What If' DAR. A "What If" DAR can be obtained by filing a request with the Registrar's Office.

If you did, you attended here under the quarter system. The DARS system on campus can only produce an audit for students that are following a catalog effective in 1990 or later. You can switch to a newer catalog by coming to the Registrar's Office, 105 North Hall. You should speak with your advisor before hand to determine if you should switch and if so which newer catalog you should switch to. DARS were designed for semester students, so students with quarter credits may need some manual adjustments to their DAR.

During the final enrollment period of your graduate program leading to the Master's degree, you must successfully complete a written and/or oral comprehensive examination prepared and administered by your graduate committee.

If you are unsuccessful in the comprehensive examination, you may, upon approval of the Graduate Council, reschedule the examination after a delay of six months. If you receive an incomplete on the comprehensive examination, you must make up the deficiencies identified by the chair of the committee.

In the case of an oral examination, you will receive a form for reporting the time (a block of two hours) and location to the Graduate Office, and you are responsible for making these arrangements with the committee. You must make all such arrangements and report them to the Graduate Office at least two weeks before the examination and not later than four weeks before the end of the term or session or the commencement ceremony in which you plan to be granted the degree. For an oral examination to be held during the summer, you should make arrangements during the spring semester.

All Plan A (thesis) candidates will take an oral examination about the thesis. This may be in addition to a written comprehensive, if required by the department concerned. All Plan B or Plan C candidates will take a written and/or oral examination based on specified program requirements. You are responsible for meeting with all members of your graduate committee before the examination to discuss how to prepare for the written and/or oral examination.

You will defend your master's paper in an oral examination by the three members of your graduate committee. Master's papers will be signed by the advisor and sent to the Graduate Office. The paper will not be bound. A copy will be filed in the Archives, as well as in the department.

Because each member of your graduate committee must approve your completed thesis, you must inform all three members of the committee about the development of the problem, research progress, and results, as well as the writing of the thesis. You will defend your thesis in an oral examination.

Three copies of the thesis must be filed for binding. Following approval by your graduate committee, you will pay a ten dollar ($10) per copy binding fee in the University's Business Office. When you present your receipt to the Graduate Office, the Dean of Graduate and Professional Studies will sign the title page of the thesis. The three copies will then be sent out for binding. It is your responsibility to check the manuscripts for proper pagination and deliver them to the Graduate Office.

If you take undergraduate courses, each three undergraduate credits will count as two graduate credits in calculating your load. Graduate assistants must take at least eight credits and no more than twelve credits.

The grade of "SP" (satisfactory progress) may be used in field-based or research-oriented classes where the nature of the work involved requires more calendar time than is available during the term for which the student is registered for the course. Upon completion of the project, this special grade will be changed to an appropriate letter grade.

You must maintain a "B" (3.0) average in your area of specialization, as well as on an overall basis. In determining this average, transfer credit will not be included. If you do not maintain a "B" (3.0) average, you will be placed on probation for the next enrollment period.

If you are placed on probation, you must earn a "B" average in the next enrollment period for full-time students and in the next 12 credits earned for part-time students. If you do not succeed in doing so, you will not be allowed to register for further courses.

If, after discussing the grade with the instructor, you still believe that the grade is inappropriate, you may appeal in writing to the department chairperson. You must do this before the end of the semester (excluding summer) following the assignment of the grade. The chairperson will submit your written claim to the instructor, who will prepare a written response. A copy of the instructor's response will be furnished to you within three weeks after the chairperson receives your request.

If, after you receive the instructor's response, you are still dissatisfied, you must notify the chairperson and Dean of Graduate Studies of this in writing within two weeks of receiving the response. The Dean will convene a meeting with you, the instructor, and the chairperson and try to resolve the grading conflict. Both you and the instructor shall provide copies of any course work which is in your possession. The burden of the proof is on you to demonstrate evidence of misgrading. The Dean will inform you in writing of the outcome of this meeting. If the grade you appeal was assigned by the chairperson, the Dean will receive your initial appeal and request a faculty member to replace the chairperson or program director in the appeal proceedings. If the issue is not resolved in your meeting with the Dean, the instructor and the chairperson, you may appeal to the Vice Chancellor, whose decision is final.

To graduate, you must have met all the minimum requirements for the master's degree. You must have earned all credits accepted toward the degree, including transfer credit, within the preceding seven years. The Graduate Council may approve a single extension in the case of unusual health conditions, fulfillment of military obligations, or similar extenuating circumstances.

If you plan to write a thesis or you are enrolled in a program that requires a committee for a final comprehensive examination, the Office of Graduate Studies will appoint your graduate committee when the tentative degree plan is accepted. Your adviser will chair the committee, which will include another graduate faculty member from your area of specialization and one member from outside your area of specialization. Your committee will evaluate your thesis, conduct your oral comprehensive, or evaluate your examination papers when an open-ended written comprehensive is used.

College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Science has provided training in the agricultural sciences since 1912. It has earned an outstanding reputation for quality education and service to the people of Wisconsin. UW-River Falls operates two laboratory farms which are an integral part of the educational program. Many classes in animal sciences, agronomy, horticulture, soil science, environmental science and management, and agricultural engineering meet on the farm for the laboratory portion of the course. In addition to the production of crops, the laboratory farms support horse, beef and dairy cattle units, a swine herd and a sheep flock. Demonstrations and experimental plots are also provided for student use. Cropland and livestock production facilities are used for classroom and hands-on educational purposes. Modern facilities house the animals and are used to demonstrate the relationships between management, nutrition, breeding, and environment.

Located south of River Falls, the Campus Farm includes acreage for crops and houses dairy cattle and horse operations. Included on the farm is a pavilion with a heated arena for "on the farm" lectures, a dairy barn, milking parlor, horse barn, and a rodeo arena. A multi-purpose arena is utilized for livestock shows and sales, horse science course work, an indoor riding area & colt barn.

FFA Career Development Events take place here as well. A six acre site on the northwest edge of the farm is devoted to agronomy, horticulture and forestry projects. These laboratory plots are used by students for research, observation, and practical learning experience. An intercollegiate rodeo is held each fall at the rodeo arena.

Facilities include beef finishing lots, swine farrowing and finishing barns, and sheep barns with heated lambing rooms. Feed processing, grain drying, and storage units are located here. Rations for all livestock are formulated and processed with these facilities. The farm's cropland produces a majority of the feed required for the livestock production.

An interdisciplinary composting research and demonstration area resides here as well. In addition an indoor classroom and pavalion that is used for instruction, FFA contests and workshops, livestock shows and sales, outreach programming is featured.

Lake. The lake is approximately 2 miles long and 1/4 mile wide at the maximum. The surface area varies considerably as the water level rises and falls, but it is generally close to 200 acres. Since the lake itself has no inlet or outlet, its major water supply is either ground water or seepage.

The ecological characteristics of the area are extremely diverse. Most of the forested area consists of regrowth, but there are scattered patches of virgin pine and hemlock. In addition, the site is enhanced by the existence of bogs, abandoned fields, cattail marshes, lakes and streams as well as numerous other aquatic habitats.

In this Web site, you'll find: details about our facilities, including regulations and maps; courses offered during the summer at Pigeon Lake; information for faculty and students planning to visit the station; fees for the coming year; and contact information for all UW campuses.

The University of Wisconsin-River Falls is beginning the process of self-study and reflection that will lead to the development of an institutional report in preparation for a campus visit from HLC/NCA in the Spring of 2008.

This is an essential component for continued accreditation of the programs on campus. Although accreditation is a voluntary process, it is required for an institution to be qualified to participate in federal student financial aid programs. Accreditation also provides an indication of institutional quality that allows students to transfer and have their credits accepted by other universities and graduate programs. The Self-Study will require the participation of people from every part of the campus as we look carefully at what we have been doing to maintain quality and as we examine our plans for the future of the university.

This unique study abroad program has allowed hundreds of students to chart their own course to Europe since 1963. You will have the satisfaction of planning your own project; carrying out research in a European country of your choice; living, learning and traveling independently; and creating a final project that will very likely be the highlight of your academic career at UWRF.

This advisor and the SA: Europe  staff will help you shape the scope of your study and assist you in making overseas contacts prior to your trip to Europe in the fall. When you arrive in Europe, you will be fully prepared to spend eight to ten weeks focusing on your topic.

Each project is unique and requires an individualized approach to conducting research. Some of the methods that SA: Europe  participants use to gather their information in Europe include: conducting personal interviews with contacts, using specialized materials at libraries and museums, doing volunteer work for organizations, and auditing a class or classes at a local university.

SA: Europe participants have done projects in almost every discipline taught on campus. You can develop a completely new and unique project or explore a new approach to a topic that has been done previously.

To prepare you to get the most out of your immersion in European culture in the fall, you will attend a series of International Study Seminar meetings during the preceding spring semester. These meetings, held on Tuesday evenings, will cover research skills, health and safety issues, travel tips, and cultural information.

SA: Europe  allows you to live and work independently; however, you will also be staying in contact with the group leader--an SA: Europe staff member who remains in Europe throughout the fall to provide support, encouragement and advice. He or she will also visit you at your research location to discuss your project. The group leader is committed to helping you have a successful and rewarding experience abroad.

Do you want to spend some time exploring Prague? Maybe a week in a village in Tuscany? Hiking in Switzerland? It's up to you. In addition to traveling, many students wisely use this time to start writing their project papers.

UW-River Falls students may apply to SA: Europe  if they have an overall grade point average of 2.25 or higher, are not on academic probation, and have achieved Junior status (earned at least 60 credits before departure for Europe). Attendance at the Tuesday night International Study Seminar meetings during Spring Semester is a prerequisite for traveling to Europe in the fall.

Students register for 12-15 credits for the fall semester: six credit hours in a specific subject area (usually counting as electives toward a major or minor) and six hours of general electives or liberal arts credits. Students with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher may arrange for three additional credits of independent study.

Students make a variety of living arrangements while in Europe. Many stay in youth hostels or inexpensive family-run hotels. Some rent small, furnished apartments on a weekly or monthly basis. Others arrange accommodation through project contacts often resulting in home stays.

Of course, your individual lifestyle will determine how much money you will need in Europe. Any financial aid that applies toward your on-campus tuition can also be used for this program. In fact the Office of Financial Assistance recognizes that students in study abroad programs often have a higher level of need, and it can offer you additional aid. Special loans and scholarships are also available for study abroad.

University Center is the gathering place for the campus community - students, staff, faculty, alumni, friends, and guests. University Center offers social, cultural, recreational and educational programs and services which help make your time on campus more comfortable and enjoyable.Just as important as the creature comforts and services that University Center offers, is the vital role it serves in linking classroom learning with life experiences and out-of-class learning opportunities. Through organized activities, or by simply providing an environment conducive to interaction and personal growth, University Center serves as a learning laboratory for social responsibility, citizenship, and global awareness. The focus on the environment is very important to the students at UWRF. During the planning stages for University Center, UWRF students voted to dedicate an extra one million dollars toward sustainable development in the building. To find out more about the sustainable features in the building, check out the Green Kiosk across from the Information Desk in University Center.

This option is designed for those seeking to apply their unique interests, knowledge, and skills to the benefit of their community. Working with a faculty advisor, each student develops a customized, experientially based degree plan allowing them to focus on a specific sustainability emphasis. Students can choose from community-based agricultural production, food processing, land use planning, nature tourism, or conservation/biology just to name a few.

An overall undergraduate grade point average of at least 2.75 (on a four-point scale) or an average of at least 2.90 based on the last 60 semester credits (90 quarter credits) of the undergraduate program.

UW-River Falls has a rich history of supporting sustainability both on campus and in its service area of the St. Croix Valley. The University defines sustainability principles in their broadest context of economic, ecological, social justice, and human and physical resources that meet current needs without decreasing opportunities for future generations.

A campus Sustainability Council is fully exploring all aspects of this issue: curricular and co-curricular programming, and operations and maintenance practices to develop policies, procedures, programs and benchmarks.

Faculty and staff are working with Wisconsin Public Power Inc., Xcel Energy, and non-governmental organizations to form partnerships to create opportunities for academic programming, and installation and implementation of alternative energy generation. Recommendations for action will be made by December.

UW-RF is a member of Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. Further, the campus is reviewing becoming a signatory of the Talloires Declaration, which is a statement outlining sustainability values and practices signed by hundreds of national and international universities and colleges. The UW-RF Student Senate has recommended the campus adopt this declaration for a sustainable future.

Sustainability principles are incorporated into many courses at UW-RF. The University offers a major and minor in Environmental Science and incorporates the principles into majors and minors in Conservation and Geology as well as a minor in Hydrogeology. Graduate academic offerings include a certificate program in Wildlife Recreation and Nature Tourism, and a master’s degree option in Sustainable Community Development.

UW-RF’s current strategic planning process has identified developing a sustainable campus as one of 10 goals. The process will identify three sustainability initiatives with nine tasks for implementation. These could include such activities as focusing on changing behavior on campus and in the region by further infusing the principles into majors and minors, as well as general education courses.

The strategic plan will investigate such tangible steps as developing wind energy power plants on campus, pursuing solar generation, employing green roofs on buildings, reviewing purchasing processes for recycled goods, and investigating the most efficient methods to transport people and goods.

In January, the campus will open its new $35 million Student Center, which is a model of sustainability. Funded in its entirety by students, the budget includes $1 million dedicated to sustainability measures. All phases of the new Student Center have an emphasis on this concept. The Ames Building, which previously occupied the site, had over 90 percent of its contents recycled. The Student Center construction process required that almost all construction waste materials be separately recycled. The majority of building materials came from less than 500 miles, reducing energy costs for transportation to the building site.

Student Center design elements include a 48,000 gallon storage capacity of collected rain water that is used for grey flush water. The structure incorporates natural building materials, with a white roof to reflect sunlight, along with many other features. The design will result in a 40 percent energy reduction compared to other contemporary student unions. Additional sustainability elements include cleaning chemicals that are Green Seal certified as well as water saving cleaning equipment. An educational kiosk will also be on display in the Great Hall, which will monitor various elements of the building’s resource consumption.

UW-RF Students have actively encouraged energy conservation. Last spring semester the Student Senate, ECO Club, and several residence-hall based student groups encouraged students to be energy efficient, which resulted in a 7 percent reduction in water, heat and electrical consumption in housing. The education program is being continued this academic year for the 2,500 students who live on campus.

UW-RF has continued its energy efficiency monitoring for more than 30 years. Lighting and flooring replacement projects in residence halls are contributing to energy savings, as well as reducing maintenance and replacement costs. Toilets and light fixtures have been replaced with energy and resource efficient fixtures in academic buildings.

The campus has an extensive recycling program. In 2005, the campus recycled a combined 185 tons of plastic and Styrofoam containers, paper products, and food waste. Thousands more items also were recycled, including: batteries, tires, oil, computer components, appliances, light tubes and incandescent bulbs, and pallets. Over 150 cubic yards of compost and chipping were produced.

Anyone who was on campus in the days when the Falcon basketball team played in the "cracker box" gymnasium of North Hall has one indelible memory of Dr. R. A. Karges. "Kargie" would dash out to the middle of the playing floor at any lull in the game to check the scoreboard.

Dr. Karges coached the basketball team from 1910 to 1912. In those days the school could afford travel for only two conference games and filled out the season by playing area high schools. Dr. Karges was a favorite speaker at alumni meetings and once told a group that his teams "had never lost a high school game."

In tribute to him, President E. H. Kleinpell wrote that he "combined in a single personality the most admirable of all attributes of a teacher -- an interest in young people and a concern in their welfare, dedication to a field of learning, a wide range of interests outside his specialty and an intense loyalty to `his' college."

Located as we are, among the erstwhile prairies and forested uplands of the St. Croix Valley, we wish to live and teach in harmony with the natural rhythms and cycles that make the area unique. And, working with our neighbors, we hope to promote richly satisfying, just, and sustainable relationships with this place and the planet."

The University of Wisconsin-River Falls Teacher Education Programs are designed to develop self-reflective practitioners in the areas of early childhood, elementary, middle school, and secondary education. We serve both those seeking initial certification and practicing professionals, with a view towards helping them develop the pedagogical, content, and technological skills necessary to function effectively in and contribute positively to an every changing, diverse, and democratic society. Listed below are the Wisconsin Standards which are a part of our mission.

The TESOL Majors and Minors  are English Department programs designed for both native and nonnative speakers of English. Graduates are prepared for employment in teaching English to speakers of other languages in the United States and in other countries.

Some of these programs enable students to acquire certification in teaching English as a second language in grade K-12.

Welcome to Textbook Services. If you are an undergraduate student at UW-RF, once you've registered and paid your fees, you may pick up your textbooks at Textbook Services in the lower level of the Chalmer Davee Library. Your textbook rental fee ($61.65 per semester for a full time student) has been paid as part of your tuition.

The expanded hours at the beginning and end of the semester allow for the increased volume of business during textbook issue and return. Arranging to pick up and return your textbooks during "off hours", when there are fewer other students also wishing to pick up and return textbooks, may save you time spent waiting in line. In general, the least busy times during book issue are anytime the week before classes begin, and the evening hours after classes begin. During the finals week book return, the least busy hours are early in the week and evening hours.

Theta Chi Fraternity is an international fraternity that has been a part of the greek system across America since 1856, and has been at UW-RF since 1968. Theta Chi is what is known as a "social" fraternity rather than a "professional" fraternity. Being a social fraternity means that you don't have to be in a specific degree field to be a member.

We also have no religious or ethnic affiliation. Any male, full-time student with good academic standing can be an active member of the Zeta Sigma Chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity. Theta Chi is in good standing with the University of Wisconsin - River Falls, and the local community.

An official transcript of a student's academic record is maintained by the Registrar's Office. The permanent record is considered confidential between the student and the University. No transcripts are released, except to authorized representatives within the University, without the written permission of the student.

For your security, no requests can be taken over the phone or e-mail. Transcripts will not be faxed. Transcripts cannot be released until all financial obligations to the University have been met and all financial holds have been removed.

The veterans representatives are students and will not be able to hold regular office hours, but many forms can be picked up and submitted in 321 North Hall without a representative present. Students receiving benefits at UW-River Falls for the first time must meet with a representative and fill out additional forms.

Across the campuses of America there are hundreds of academic buildings, student centers, residence halls, libraries and other structures, all bearing names that had meaning at the time of the dedication, but with the years, memory of the reason for the original name has faded.

Such is the case at UW-River Falls.  There are 20 buildings, several rooms and Ramer Field carrying the names of regents, faculty and students who in some way contributed to this University's reputation as a place where teaching has always been important.  Only a few campus buildings carry names such as Centennial Hall or South Hall.

Last winter Chancellor Gary Thibodeau wrote one of the authors calling attention to the need for information of where the campus buidings' names orginated.  He said that there are many faculty who have no knowledge of who "Hathorn" of Hathorn Hall was and a host of students who may spend four years in May or McMillan Halls or go to the Blanche Davis Theatre in the Kleinpell Fine Arts building and never know just who Kleinpell or May or McMillan or Davis were or what they did to make this institution what it offers students today.

The authors have been members of the University faculty for many years and are now retired.  Dr. Wolfe was professor of journalism and Assistant Chancellor and Dr. Wyman was professor of history and Honorary Folklorist for Wisconsin for many years.  They have known a number of the people whose names appear on buildings and rooms, and readily accepted Chancellor Thibodeau's suggestion to answer "What's in a Name?".

The purpose of the Western Wisconsin Partnership for Children and Families is to improve the quality of services provided to children at risk of out-of-home placement and their families through a comprehensive, competency-based child welfare training system.

A minor in Women's Studies presents students with the following: past and present scholarship on women; a methodology which treats the experience of both sexes as equal in value and scholarly importance; and opportunities to conduct interdisciplinary research in women's studies.  The minor consists of a core unit and elective courses in many disciplines, for a total of 23 credit hours (minimum).

The Writing Center staff consists of undergraduate students, from a variety of majors, who have been specifically trained. The director of the Writing Center is professor David Furniss of the English Department.

Undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in classes from all subject areas can visit the Center for assistance in all stages of composing (inventing, revising, editing), and to improve skills (spelling, punctuation, paragraph development, organization).

When can students use the Center? Students can stop by the Center anytime; however, we encourage students to meet with a tutor on a regular basis if they want to significantlt improve their writing skills. Each tutor works a limited number of hours, students need to make an appointment ahead of time.

Welcome to the Writing Center! We understand that asking for assistance with your writing may be difficult. Each of us assumes that we should be able to write well without any effort. The truth is that almost everyone feels anxious about writing and that nearly everyone's writing needs objective feedback and positive reinforcement. The Writing Center is the right place to get that kind of assistance.

We would like to simplify this process as much as we can: first, by getting to know you and how you think and write, then by pointing out your writing strengths, and encouraging you to do your best thinking. To do this, we ask questions, discuss, and brainstorm together. You do the writing, we help with the process.

At your next session, your revised work will be much closer to the final product. Together we will talk about further expansion and deletion, transitiions between ideas, mechanical problems, and the presentation of the final product.

"But I only wanted my punctuation checked," you say. Our experience has demonstarted to us that students often have anxiety about WRITING. They frequently assume that flawless punctuation equals fine writing. Effective writing means good ideas carefully explained. Our interest in The Writing Center is to help you state your ideas strongly and clearly. We are not a proofreading service; we are trained consultants, experienced writers who like to help students do their best.

Based on the story of ballroom dancer Pierre Dulaine, a former professional dancer (Antonio Banderas) volunteers to teach dance in the New York public school system. Although his background first clashes with his students' tastes, together they create a completely new style of dance while gaining social awareness, confidence, and self esteem.

Pierre Dulaine, director of the American Ballroom Theater's dance program, is a passionate man. He took his ability in ballroom dance and built a career upon it; then he took the dancing out of the studio and into the streets with his community outreach program "Dancing Classrooms". Now in more than sixty NYC schools, "Dancing Classrooms" helps over 7,500 elementary school children gain crucial life skills as they move into young adulthood. At the podium, Dulaine leads the audience into the light with life changing advice, insight from his inspiring career and his unique, successful take on mentoring and community involvement.

"Journey to a Hate Free Millennium" is the multiple award-winning documentary that seeks solutions to ending HATE and the terrible hate crimes that have become frequent events in our daily lives. The stirring and powerful film centers around true stories taken direct from the national headlines including: The dreadful student shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado; the torturous dragging death of James Byrd, Jr., an African-American man in Texas; and the brutal beating death of Matthew Shephard, a gay college student in Wyoming. Viewers are invited to take a stand against HATE and create their own vision of a world free of HATE, where senseless acts of violence are a thing of the past.

The River Falls campus is active with many activities to help with student development both in and out of the classroom. While River Falls has not held a state wide or regional conference; we have held many conferences for UW-River Falls students. Our bid team has worked together to put together a number of conferences for River Falls students which provide many programs similar to what Wisconsin students receive when they attend WURHA.

Students who have voluntarily interrupted their university work, who were in good academic standing at the time of last attendance, and have no financial obligations to the University will be granted re-entry status upon application to the Registrar.

If you have applied for financial assistance and have received an award letter indicating the types and amounts of aid you are eligible for make sure that you follow the instructions contained on the award letter insert  to accept and process your loans and accept the federal work study award.

If you applied for financial assistance you may have received a letter indicating you did not demonstrate financial need sufficient to receive grants and other need-based awards at the University. This determination was made by comparing the cost of attendance from the University to your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) calculated from information you submitted on your FAFSA.

If you or your family have unusual circumstances that have not been considered when you completed the "Free Application for Federal Student Aid" (FAFSA) check the table below to determine your options.

The Office of Financial Assistance  would like to congratulate you on your admission to the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and welcome you to the University community. The information below is intended to help you complete the application process for federal and state student financial assistance.

Financial Aid is given on an annual basis. A student must reapply each year. After the student files the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) during the first year a 'Renewal FAFSA' is produced for each subsequent year. This 'Renewal FAFSA' asks the student to update various parts of the application; however, data elements that don't change, such as social security number, date of birth are pre-printed and do not need to be completed again. The renewal application significantly reduces the amount of time required to complete the process.

The major source of student financial aid is the U.S. Department of Education. About 70% of the student aid that is awarded each year comes from the U.S. Department of Education's programs.  The Department's aid includes grants, loans, and work-study.

Free materials available in the financial aid office at your college or career school or the guidance office at your high school include the FAFSA as well as The Student Guide and Funding Your Education (two booklets that provide detailed information about the U.S. Department of Education's programs). You also may request copies of the FAFSA or either of the two booklets by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) toll free at the number shown below. The FSAIC's operators can answer your questions about federal student aid and the application process.

This financial aid notification letter is informational only and assumes your acceptance of all grants/scholarships offered – it does NOT assume your acceptance of loans or federal work study offered. You will need to access eSIS Self Service to accept the loans and/or federal work study offered.

Cancellation of assistance is possible. Your assistance is based on the submission of financial data from the federal financial aid application. Should University representatives detect and verify irregularities, which are not subsequently corrected, they have the right to suspend an award and request repayment of previously paid assistance. In addition, the University reserves the right to request any appropriate documentation necessary to determine or verify applicant information. Withholding of requested material will result in the suspension of assistance.

Federal regulations require that UW-River Falls provide enrolled and prospective students with specific consumer information about the university. The following list tells you the information that must be disclosed and links to that information or its source. If you would prefer to get the information in writing, you may request it from the appropriate office.

Federal Perkins loan borrowers-Interest will begin as soon as you consolidate, rather than 9 months after you leave school; you will forfeit all cancellation benefits otherwise available to Perkins borrowers.

You do NOT have to include all of your loans in a consolidation. For example, if you want to keep Perkins loan separate because you might be able to cancel a portion, you can do that although you need to be aware that you will have a separate loan payment.

You may have received mailings and phone calls regarding consolidation from many different lenders and organizations, causing questions and confusion about the program. The Federal Consolidation loan program is regulated by the Department of Education which means that lenders use the same formula when calculating interest rates and determining repayment terms. You should contact your current Stafford loan lender for information on whether a consolidation loan is right for you.

This website explains student financial aid programs the U.S. Department of Education's Federal Student Aid (FSA) office administers. These first few pages summarize this aid and the process involved. The rest of the publication discusses in detail what you need to know.

This is an introductory website for students not yet enrolled in a postsecondary school, provides general information about the U.S. Department of Education's federal student financial aid programs and how to apply for them.

You can help ensure the fair and equitable treatment of all financial aid applicants by reporting suspected federal financial aid fraud to the U.S. Department of Education Office of the Inspector General .

Use the chart below to compare the features of each type of loan program. Once you have decided which program you want to use, click on the links provided at the top of the column to process the loan.

Interest accrues while student is in school. Some programs require student to make minimum monthly payments or interest-only payments while in school. If deferred, repayment usually begins 6 months after student graduates or leaves school.

A Federal Perkins Loan is a low-interest (5 percent) loan for both undergraduate and graduate students with financial need. Your school is your lender. The loan is made with government funds, and your school contributes a share. You must repay this loan to your school.

The University of Wisconsin - River Falls is extremely happy to announce that completion of all paperwork and the signing of promissory notes for Federal Perkins can be completed online. No longer do you, the student, have to wait for the mail and then return the forms to us. It is all performed online.

Step 1. All first time UWRF Perkins loan recipients are required to complete an entrance interview prior to receiving funds. You will be prompted to complete the Entrance Interview as you complete the Master Promissory Note online (see Step 2).

Your loan proceeds will not be disbursed until all electronic documents are filled out completely, accurately and approved by the Cashier's Office.. It is important that you complete this process as soon as possible. All tuition and fees are due by the due date regardless of the status of financial aid and this loan. Complete immediately .

Federal regulations require that you be notified annually of the amount of your outstanding balance. In addition to meeting the federal requirements ECSI will send an email notification to all current borrowers when a disbursement and/or adjustnment is made on your account during the current academic year.

A PLUS loan is a loan that is taken out by parents to pay for education expenses for their dependent undergraduate student enrolled at least half time. Parents must have no adverse credit history. PLUS Loans are unsubsidized the interest rate is fixed at 8.5%. Parents may borrow up to the amount of their child's educational costs (as set by the Office of Financial Assistance) minus any other financial aid he or she may receive.

The repayment period begins on the day after the loan if fully disbursed. The first payment will be due within 60 days after the final loan disbursement. The parent borrower is required to pay both principal and the interest that accumulates. Some lenders may offer parents an option to postpone payments.

As college tuition and expenses increase, you may want to explore private student loans as alternative sources of funding, in addition to federal student loan programs available through the Federal Family Education Loan Program and other family resources. Alternative, or private student loans, provide funds to meet the cost of education once other sources of aid have been depleted or when annual federal student loan limits have been reached. These credit-based loans offer flexibility in choosing a school or participating in a specialized course of study because borrowers do not have to worry about federal forms or deadlines. They may also cover any education expenses such as personal computers.

Once you have completed the steps above and a signed promissory note is in place, the lender will send UW-River Falls an electronic "Request for Certification". Upon receipt of this request UW-River Falls will certify the loan. The lender will then submit the loan proceeds electronically to the school, per the disbursement dates specified in the certification. The funds will be credited to your account after they are receieved from the lender.

As we head into the end of finals week and the twin commencements on Saturday, it is gratifying to look back across the 2005-06 academic year. It has been a time of transition, change and progress. At this juncture, it is important that we prepare well for the coming year and beyond. This means our collaborative work on strategic planning.

The strategic planning group (click on Leadership Council at http://www.uwrf.edu/administration/  to view membership) has been established and it includes representation of all our shared governance groups.

The objectives that will emerge for the planning efforts will be directly linked to our core values, mission and vision. Some of our goals will be short term, while other will require a multi-year commitment. The key is establishing and following the plan.

I am pleased that Dr. John Dew will be joining us to initiate and guide our university-wide efforts. One of the founders of the National Consortium for Continuous Improvement (NCCI), John is the director of Planning and Quality for the University of Alabama and one of the bright lights in higher education planning in the country. I have had the good fortune of working with him for several years during which he has been a valued advisor to many institutions.

Planning is dynamic, not static. It will evolve and change over time at UW-River Falls, just as we will. We will look forward to assisting one another in learning and applying the principles and lessons of sound strategic planning. In this way we create a broader coalition of planners here at the university.

Change is inevitable; it will occur. Our goal is to lead, guide and contour change to meet the needs of those we serve and to realize our mission, pursue our vision with passion and conviction always guided by our core values.

The stage thus is set for the next phase of our intentional efforts to plan our future. Many of our colleagues will be working to these ends through the summer, including inviting John Dew to join us. Please join with our Steering Committee, Connie Foster, Bob Baker, Valerie Malzacher and Gregg Heinselman, and our Strategic Planning Group, in actively creating the strategic plan that will meet the needs of the stakeholders we serve, and will inspire us to pursue our goals with creativity, imagination and persistence.

Members of the Strategic Planning Steering Committee welcome your input regarding the strategic planning process. The primary role of this committee is to develop the framework and timelines for strategic planning and guide the campus in planning processes.

In preparation for the workshop, Dr. Dew visited campus on June 26, 2006 to meet with a number of individuals that will be closely involved in the strategic planning process. Recommendations from those individuals are guiding the planning for the August 23-24 workshop.

During the workshop, Dr. Dew wil lead the group through a number of steps, including a time-line exercise, a SWOT analysis, and a visioning exercise. A nominal group technique will be employed to help the group quickly focus on strategic goals. See full workshop agenda for additional details.

The Strategic Planning Steering Committee has organized a variety of required and recommended readings for workshop participants and for all individuals interested in learning more about strategic planning at UW-RF.

More than 100 members of the campus community attended his session to learn about the strategic planning process, outcomes from the Strategic Planning Workshop, and steps that will be followed to develop action plans related to strategic goals.

UWRF will be a leader in developing a sustainable society in which current needs are met without decreasing opportunities for future generations.

Welcome to the University of Wisconsin-River Falls! The following is what happens regarding Student Services and Programs when you are accepted to the University for the Fall term. If your first term will be J-Term, Spring, or Summer, things happen a little differently.Starting the previous November and soon after you are admitted to UWRF, you will receive through the mail a brochure that tells you about housing opportunities on campus and lets you know how to sign a housing contract. Signing a contract is an online process.

If you would like to live on campus (and we hope you do!), go online to sign the housing contract and pay the housing deposit. The sooner you do this the better since your room assignment is based on the received date of the contract and deposit. You can also give us your vaccination datesat the same time.If you decide not to live on campus, make sure you meet the exemption requirements.If you would like to commute and you meet the requirements for commuting, you will need to complete a commuter application. This can be done online.If you will be living on campus, you can tell us your housing preferences. You can also request a roommate. These services start during the preceding March time frame and end when the actual room assignments are made in the summer.Part of university life is to broaden your experience and one way to do this is to be a member of a student organization. You can tell us which organizations interest you at the same time you tell us your housing preferences.If you would like to participate in one of our meal plans, tell us which meal plan you would like to be on. Freshmen and sophomores living in the residence halls are required to participate in a meal plan; many others find our meal plans valuable and participate in them.

After room assignments are made in the summer, you will receive a letter letting you know of your room assignment. This letter also includes your roommate contact information. It would be best to contact your roommate in order to find out a bit about each other and determine who is going to bring what. If you didn't get your preferred side of campus or requested roommate, it was because when housing assignments were made in the order that the housing contract and deposit were received, and your preferred areas were already filled before your assignment.Take a look at our last minute checklist of items to bring, and what not to bring!For any computer, television, or phone support questions contact FredNet.FredNet also has a store for cables and other accessories you may need and forgot to bring with you.To give yourself more space in your room on campus, consider renting a loft.If you plan on bringing a car to campus, Public Safety and Parking Office has the parking rules and regulations.It would be wise to attend WOW!

Although the rugby team is technically a club sport because it is not sanctioned by the NCAA, we are not a typical club sport in that we are not confined to competition on campus only. Collegiate rugby is taken just as seriously by the participants as football or hockey may be. Rugby has been traditionally an international sport but it is growing in the U.S. Almost every college in the U.S. fields a team. Our governing body is USA RUGBY which is an organization that not only governs colleiate level rugby but also the international level as well. All players must be registered with USA RUGBY to be eligable. We have a fall and spring season in which we play teams from around the midwest including schools from Wis., Min., N. Dakota, and Canada. There are playoffs and a state, regional (i.e. midwest, deep south, pacific, etc.) and national champion are crowned in three divisions.

All of us girls on the team come in all different shapes and sizes, as well as personalites. Even though we have these differences, we form close friendships through the practice and play of the sport of rugby. No experience is needed to play, just the willingness to have fun, and to try something new. Rugby is a unique sport that has been played all over the world, and is quickly gaining popularity in the US. It is a sport rich with traditions and history, including songs and camaraderie. The main goal of the game of rugby is almost the same as football; carry a ball across a goal line without being tackled. The major differences are the fact that we wear no pads or helmets, and there is no stoppage of play, much like soccer.

All of the tackling and running is a great way to keep in shape! We have two seasons, one in the spring and another in the fall. We play teams from all over Minnesota, Wisconsin, and even teams from Canada! Rugby gives you the oppertunity to not only travel around our country and meet some great people, but around the world as well. Come on out and give rugby a try; the friendships and memories made will last a lifetime.

During the final enrollment period of your graduate program leading to the Master's degree, you must successfully complete a written and/or oral comprehensive examination prepared and administered by your graduate committee.

If you are unsuccessful in the comprehensive examination, you may, upon approval of the Graduate Council, reschedule the examination after a delay of six months. If you receive an incomplete on the comprehensive examination, you must make up the deficiencies identified by the chair of the committee.

In the case of an oral examination, you will receive a form for reporting the time (a block of two hours) and location to the Graduate Office, and you are responsible for making these arrangements with the committee. You must make all such arrangements and report them to the Graduate Office at least two weeks before the examination and not later than four weeks before the end of the term or session or the commencement ceremony in which you plan to be granted the degree. For an oral examination to be held during the summer, you should make arrangements during the spring semester.

All Plan A (thesis) candidates will take an oral examination about the thesis. This may be in addition to a written comprehensive, if required by the department concerned. All Plan B or Plan C candidates will take a written and/or oral examination based on specified program requirements. You are responsible for meeting with all members of your graduate committee before the examination to discuss how to prepare for the written and/or oral examination.

You will defend your master's paper in an oral examination by the three members of your graduate committee. Master's papers will be signed by the advisor and sent to the Graduate Office. The paper will not be bound. A copy will be filed in the Archives, as well as in the department.

Because each member of your graduate committee must approve your completed thesis, you must inform all three members of the committee about the development of the problem, research progress, and results, as well as the writing of the thesis. You will defend your thesis in an oral examination.

Three copies of the thesis must be filed for binding. Following approval by your graduate committee, you will pay a ten dollar ($10) per copy binding fee in the University's Business Office. When you present your receipt to the Graduate Office, the Dean of Graduate and Professional Studies will sign the title page of the thesis. The three copies will then be sent out for binding. It is your responsibility to check the manuscripts for proper pagination and deliver them to the Graduate Office.

If you take undergraduate courses, each three undergraduate credits will count as two graduate credits in calculating your load. Graduate assistants must take at least eight credits and no more than twelve credits.

The grade of "SP" (satisfactory progress) may be used in field-based or research-oriented classes where the nature of the work involved requires more calendar time than is available during the term for which the student is registered for the course. Upon completion of the project, this special grade will be changed to an appropriate letter grade.

You must maintain a "B" (3.0) average in your area of specialization, as well as on an overall basis. In determining this average, transfer credit will not be included. If you do not maintain a "B" (3.0) average, you will be placed on probation for the next enrollment period.

If you are placed on probation, you must earn a "B" average in the next enrollment period for full-time students and in the next 12 credits earned for part-time students. If you do not succeed in doing so, you will not be allowed to register for further courses.

If, after discussing the grade with the instructor, you still believe that the grade is inappropriate, you may appeal in writing to the department chairperson. You must do this before the end of the semester (excluding summer) following the assignment of the grade. The chairperson will submit your written claim to the instructor, who will prepare a written response. A copy of the instructor's response will be furnished to you within three weeks after the chairperson receives your request.

If, after you receive the instructor's response, you are still dissatisfied, you must notify the chairperson and Dean of Graduate Studies of this in writing within two weeks of receiving the response. The Dean will convene a meeting with you, the instructor, and the chairperson and try to resolve the grading conflict. Both you and the instructor shall provide copies of any course work which is in your possession. The burden of the proof is on you to demonstrate evidence of misgrading. The Dean will inform you in writing of the outcome of this meeting. If the grade you appeal was assigned by the chairperson, the Dean will receive your initial appeal and request a faculty member to replace the chairperson or program director in the appeal proceedings. If the issue is not resolved in your meeting with the Dean, the instructor and the chairperson, you may appeal to the Vice Chancellor, whose decision is final.

To graduate, you must have met all the minimum requirements for the master's degree. You must have earned all credits accepted toward the degree, including transfer credit, within the preceding seven years. The Graduate Council may approve a single extension in the case of unusual health conditions, fulfillment of military obligations, or similar extenuating circumstances.

If you plan to write a thesis or you are enrolled in a program that requires a committee for a final comprehensive examination, the Office of Graduate Studies will appoint your graduate committee when the tentative degree plan is accepted. Your adviser will chair the committee, which will include another graduate faculty member from your area of specialization and one member from outside your area of specialization. Your committee will evaluate your thesis, conduct your oral comprehensive, or evaluate your examination papers when an open-ended written comprehensive is used.

STEP 1: Select your program of study. Refer to the Graduate Programs page for program descriptions and admission requirements. You may apply to most programs at any time; however, certain programs have firm deadlines and require additional application materials.

Go to the department Web site  for more details.

When you have been admitted, you will be instructed to meet with your department chairperson or program coordinator, who will appoint your advisor and review possible transfer of credits. Please note that you can only transfer up to nine credits from another institution and that the Director of Graduate Studies must approve such transfers. See  Graduate Catalog Requirements for more information.

During your first term, meet with your academic advisor to discuss your academic program. With your advisor, complete and submit a tentative degree pattern to the Graduate Office for approval. If this is not approved by the Director of Graduate Studies during your first semester, you will not be able to register for further classes.

On Friday, November 3, 2006 we experienced a problem with a listserv that the university manages and which serves teachers in our region. This problem caused all recipients to receive unwanted and unintended email messages. We have corrected the problem and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience it caused you.

Educators have told us that they prefer to get information about professional development courses and graduate degrees and certificates in a timely fashion. Most teachers have indicated a preference for electronic notification. Emails are used  because they can get the word out quickly and inexpensively.

This list was developed as a means of notifying potential and current students about upcoming learning opportunities through UW-River Falls. Unlike many listservs, this list is not intended to facilitate two-way communication among members. As such, all replies to the list messages are intercepted  by the list administrator and the list of members is not made public.

Generally, an email message is sent by the Outreach and Graduate Studies office once or twice a month to list members. All postings are created exclusively by the UW-River Falls staff. The list is typically not used during the summer months. All replies to the messages sent are directed to the list administrator, who would respond appropriately just to the sender.  Email communications are not shared with the list membership.

Best practices for electronic marketing emphasize  an “opt in” process for listservs. With “opt in” listservs, members are invited but not added to the list unless they confirm that they would like to receive these emails. Under the current practices used for the Teachers Listserv, no one can be added to the listserv without the express permission of the email recipient.

We will continue to invite active UWRF students and those who have expressed an interest in any of our teaching programs or courses to participate in the listserv. However, these individuals must follow the subscription instructions or they will not receive the email messages about unique learning opportunities with UW-River Falls.

Even a moderated, closed listserv  may experience problems. Members of the list may be receiving more spam (unwanted messages)  as a result of the unintentional publication of the list membership in November 2006. We apologize for any  inconvenience as a result of this problem. Please contact your network administrator for possible solutions to this problem.

Some individuals may have set their Spam filters to block any messages from @uwrf.edu. If you are a current UWRF student or intended to take a UWRF course in the future, you should be aware that this action may inhibit any official messages from the university, such as tuition payment notices, financial aid notification, grade reports and course registration confirmations. Each UWRF student is given an email account that ends in @uwrf.edu and this is the account used for official university business. If you are currently a student or an UWRF alumni, please remove this filter so that your communications with the university are not inhibited.

For more information about the listserv, visit the web page or send an email to: Teachers Listserv and the administrator will reply to your request. Your request will not be sent to other members on the list.

I want to be admitted as a TEMPORARY graduate student to take graduate level classes without receiving a degree or certification.

You will need a cable-ready television in order to view all the TV channels offered on campus. Most televisions built in the past 10-15 years are likely to be cable-ready.Sometimes you may have to change a setting on the unit if it was previously only recieving a UHF/VHF(antenna) signal and not a cable line. This option can be a switch on the back of the unit; though more often it is found within the television's menu system.Since the layout of these menus can vary greatly, we cannot provide universal instructions for them. However, there is usually a setting somewhere which allows you to switch between an antenna(ANT) and a cable(CATV) signal.For more help, contact FredNet or consult your television's documentation for more detailed information.You will also need a coaxial (television) cable in order to view TV channels.

Civic engagement takes place in many forms. Whether  it’s designing environmentally friendly buildings, expressing our opinions on  blogs, or creating safe climates in the classroom, we make a difference in our  respective communities at physical, virtual, and social-psychological levels.

This conference invites you to  explore the myriad spaces where students, faculty, alumni, staff and local  residents can come together to exchange ideas, solve problems, and improve the  physical and intellectual environments on college campuses.

Presentation proposals are  welcome from all disciplines. The approach may be aesthetic, scientific,  literary, economic, journalistic, pedagogical, political, philosophical,  social, psychological, technical, or any other way of knowing. Presentations  will be categorized into three broad areas: Physical Spaces, Virtual Spaces,  and Social-Psychological Spaces.

Special recognition will be given  to campuses having the most sustainable space for civic engagement in each of  the three categories, and to campuses with the most innovative ideas for  creating sustainable spaces in each of the three categories (physical, virtual, and social-psychological).  Recognition will be based upon the votes of program session attendees.

Chancellor Don Betz spoke passionately about our mission to create ethical and engaged graduates who have a global perspective during his inauguration speech April 28. He was installed as the 16th chancellor of university at an afternoon ceremony in the Knowles Center, addressing an audience of 700 alumni, faculty, staff, students community members, family, friends, colleagues, public servants and invited guests.

The Friday ceremony capped off a week of events designed to showcase the university's commitment to learning and service. Such themes as globalization, inclusiveness, and the university's prominent role in the St. Croix Valley were evident in the series of workshops, presentations, awards ceremonies, and celebratory activities.

In addition to the annual Unity in the Community celebration; college banquets; and Research, Scholarly and Creative Activity Day, inauguration week brought noted historian T. H. Baughman to Hudson for an animated lecture on the leadership lessons to be drawn from Sir Ernest Shackelton's perilous 1914-17 expedition to the south polar regions. As part of the Wyman Series, former NFL lineman Esera Tuaolo shared his personal experience as a gay player in the hyper-masculine culture of pro football in a presentation titled, "Creating a World of Tolerance." And the campus community came together on Thursday evening for a festive picnic complete with carnival games and musical entertainment.

Dignitaries from across the state then journeyed to River Falls for Friday's formal ceremony, which saw UW System President Kevin Reilly place the Chancellor's Medallion around Dr. Betz's neck, symbolizing his leadership role.

Marching at the ceremony were approximately 200 faculty and staff as well as visiting colleagues and guests from other universities dressed in traditional academic garb. They were led by English Professor and Faculty Marshal Nicholas Karolides, the most senior member of the faculty. Also participating in the processional were international students dressed in traditional costume and carrying flags representing their home countries, students who received the 2006 Chancellor’s Award for Excellence, and students who represented the more than 150 student organizations.

Is a University student broadcasters organization that has produced quality student programming, such as the weekly talk program FOCUS ON U, for the past twelve years. Focus Productions programming is aired on the University and city cable systems serving River Falls, Hudson, North Hudson, and Prescott, Wisconsin.

Besides a weekly television talk program, Focus Productions has produced a variety of other programming including late night live election returns and analysis for western Wisconsin on election night as well as periodic late night live variety programming including the show "Late Night Alternative".

Focus Productions is scheduled at the beginning of each semester. During the meeting plans for programming are discussed. In addition, opportunities for students as hosts, directors, floor managers, camera operators, etc. are explained.

The weekly television talk program "Focus on U" is the longest running television program on the University and River Falls cable television networks. "Focus On U" is produced weekly, addressing issues of interest to campus and community. Former guests appearing on "Focus" include former astronaut Dan Brandenstein, editor of "Wired" magazine John Battelle, and "Mystery Science Theatre 2000" writer and star Michael J. Nelson. "Focus On U" is taped live each week in the television studio here on campus at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls (112 Kleinpell Fine Arts). The show is brodcast over the community cable channels 19 (serving the communities of River Falls, Prescott, Hudson, and North Hudson, Wisconsin).

To be eligible for an MNLA scholarship, applicants must possess a "C" grade average or better, present letters of recommendation from instructors and employers, and submit an essay stating their career goals and objectives.

Brent Green (third from the tight) stands among the UW-River Falls delegation and their counterparts  at Shih Hsin University in Taipei following a meeting that considers a memorandum of understanding between the two universities. Related press release.

Greene talks about the process of formulating a relationship with an Asian university. He also notes the changes he has seen taking place in the People's Republic of China and addresses some misconception Americans have about that country.

Greene responds to the following: What does the UW-River Falls have to do prepeare for Asian students? What do students need to do to prepare to go overseas? What efforts are being made to getting faculty to go overseas? Who is visiting River Falls now?

In March 2006, Evan Johnson's Special Topics in Speech class joined more than 40 students and staff on a service-learning trip to the Mississippi gulf coast. This six-minute video, produced by the class, documents the university students' participation in the cleanup and rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Katrina.

For decades, popular culture has portrayed the hula as an exotic dance involving mostly hip movements. But real ancient hula performed by the Polynesian people of Hawaii is an expression of their history and connection to the islands where they live.

Nine UW-River Falls dance theatre students, under the leadership of Zhe, visited the University of Hawaii Manoa this past January for eight days of intensive study of this often misunderstood art form.

Facing the rim of the sacred Halano blowhole, students chanted in the native language while mastering the hip and wrist movements that comprise the traditional hula. "It was quite amazing," says Zhe. The ocean's spray through the blowhole actually appeared to become stronger as students improved.

"We learned to chant as a spiritual act of asking nature to guide us," recalls sophomore Sara Mickens. "At first we were shy and weak, but our voices and our spirits grew. Soon we could chant over pounding waves and feel nature respond."

Kumu (meaning hula instructor) Rich Pedrina taught the meaning of each dance and introduced and critiqued the students' technique. Men often needed helpful reminders. "They're not allowed to bend at the wrist while making wave motions as women are," says Zhe, referring to a common mistake. An island elder named Uncle Cliff taught the students how to gather and prepare ti leaves for leis. Students also learned Hawaiian history, culture and language, which offers a unique challenge, perhaps best illustrated by trying to pronounce the title of the hula school itself: O'Napunaheleonapu.

"I could go to Hawaii any time as a tourist, but having the meaningful cultural experience that I had studying with Kumu Pedrina could never be duplicated," concludes senior Diana Johnson. Members of the group performed what they had learned in Hawaii at their annual concert in March.

The situation was staged. But the scene was jarringly life-like for the 100+ students who gathered April 3 to witness "Crash on Cascade," a mock accident dramatizing the lethal combination of drinking and driving. Sponsored by UW-RF's Greek organizations and other university–community groups as part of Greek Week, the event was presented, says Theta Chi's Ryan Stovern, to give students "a realistic sense of what EMS and fire fighters have to go through" and to make students "think twice before drinking and driving."

A part of the scripted scenario, fire fighters sawed through the roof of an overturned van to remove sober high schoolers after their vehicle had been hit by a car full of alcohol-impaired university students.

We are grateful for your help —for your financial gifts, your in-kind contributions, the internship opportunities you have provided, your attendance at athletic and performing arts events, your participation on advisory boards, your volunteerism at alumni events and with our career services, and yes, even the honest criticism that you have provided.

NOTE: "Official" data is restrictively defined to enable comparisons among institutions. However, institutuions are unique and have unique internal data needs. Therefore, numbers generated for internal decisionmaking may differ from "official" data.

High level indicators will be icons identifying the University's current overall progress toward each of its strategic goals. Drill-downs will graph summary-level evidence critical to the assessment of institutional health. Detail reports will provide the data tables upon which institutional health indicators are developed.

The Executive Dashboard is still in its initial development phase. The first roll-out to the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor and Provost will contain 3 high level indicatorss (red, yellow, green) with drll-down capabilities on the following dimensions.

The Parking Department, located at 27 South Hall, is a part of the Department of Public Safety at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls . The department provides parking services to students, employees, and visitors of the University. It is a self-supporting auxiliary that is not supported by state funding or student tuition. Parking operating, maintenance, and development expenses are funded by revenue generated from the sale of parking services.

Our goal is to provide convenient and quality parking to meet the needs of the campus, community, and visitors. The Parking Program has been established to govern over the available spaces. These spaces are enforced by the use of parking permits, meters and time restrictions.

Parking is only permitted within the confines of a single marked space or in a designated parking bay in a gravel lot. Parking permits are required when parking in student and faculty/staff lots as well as physically challenged areas and loading zones. Please note that specially signed areas such as the 20 minute loading zones with flashers, fire lanes, physically challenged, state vehicle parking spaces and any other restricted space are enforced 24 hours per day. Parking is prohibited anytime on sidewalks, grassy areas, fire lanes and where curbs are painted yellow.

The responsibility of finding a legal parking space rests with the vehicle operator. A parking permit does not ensure the availability of a parking space, but grants the authorization to park in specified areas when space is available. If your permit lot is full, you must contact the Parking Department at (715) 425-3333 for instructions on where to park.

If you own, possess, or operate a vehicle on UWRF campus, you are responsible for being familiar with the regulations governing parking on campus. Parking on campus is at one's own risk and the Parking Department is not responsible for any lost or stolen items.

The Parking Department is authorized by Wisconsin Administrative Codes 18.05 and 18.06 to enforce parking compliance through the issuance of citations for violations of University parking regulations. A citation will be issued to any vehicle parking in violation of published or posted parking regulations.

The Parking Department is responsible for the enforcement of parking regulations on University lands. Parking on the city streets is enforced by the River Falls Police Department. To receive information regarding city parking, refer to their website at www.rfcity.org/police .

The University reserves the right to revoke the parking privilege and/or tow and impound vehicles of chronic violators. Vehicles become tow eligible if a balance of $100 or more is accrued by a customer. Vehicles and/or customers receiving more than ten (10) citations per semester will be subject to a chronic violator citation. Chronic violator citations are $100 (no discount allowed) per violation for subsequent violations.

A citation may be appealed by completing a Parking Appeal Form request within 10 days of the citation date. Forms are available in the Parking Office, 27 South Hall or online at our website, http://www.uwrf.edu/public-safety/general_parking.html . Appeals are decided upon by a committee once a month during the academic year. The committee is comprised of students, faculty, and staff of the University. The decision of the Parking Committee is binding on the Parking Department and appellant.

Parking permits are the hanger type and must be displayed from the rearview mirror with permit number facing the front of the vehicle. The permit holder is responsible for properly displaying the permit. Ownership of permits remain with UWRF. Resale or transfer of permits is prohibited. Use of a permit by anyone other than the registered purchaser may result in fine, revocation, confiscation, and prosecution for theft under 943.20(1)(a), Wis. State Statutes of UWS 18.06(41).

Refunds may be obtained by contacting the Parking Department. Refund requests on or before August 31, 2005 will be assessed a $5.00 cancellation fee. Any refund request thereafter will be prorated. Refund requests are then processed through the Accounting Office and may take between four and six weeks. Refunds will not be issued unless the permit is returned to the Parking Department. Permits are non-refundable after April 30, 2006.

The purpose of the Do Not Ticket List is to accommodate those holding a valid permit who are unable to find a space in their assigned lot. If your assigned lot is full, you may park in an alternate lot of the same type (i.e. students to a student lot, faculty/staff to a faculty staff lot), however you MUST  contact the Parking Department at (715) 425-3333 with your name, vehicle identification and alternate lot utilized immediately. Failure to do so will result in a citation. Messages left with incomplete information will not be accepted for the Do Not Ticket List. The Do Not Ticket List is only valid until 8:00am the next day, so measures must be taken to purchase a temporary permit, or vehicles will be ticketed. If you do not hold a valid permit on campus, you may not utilize the Do Not Ticket List unless you are a visitor. Please see the Visitor section for more information.

Students living in Residential Halls have the option of purchasing a permit to park in Student Lots pending availability of those lots. University parking lots designated for overnight student parking are: E, K, L, N, O and W. These lots are identified with a sign at each entrance indicating student permit parking along with the name of the lot. Permits are enforced in these lots from 6:00pm Sunday until 4:30pm Friday. Display of the permit authorizes parking only in the specific lot designated on the permit.

Prior to the start of a new academic year, student permits are sold first by class standing, then residence hall assignment provided they are received by the deadline set by the Parking Department. Permits sold thereafter will be sold first by an appeal process, and then through a waitlist, according to availability. The permits will then be available for pick-up from the Parking Department at the end of August. Watch for specific information on permit pick-up through campus email and on the parking website.

Students who have parking permits must return their permit to the Parking Department if they move off campus or withdraw from school. A prorated refund will then be issued; permits are non-refundable after April 30, 2006. Transferring a permit from one student to another is not allowed and will result in revocation of parking privileges, Improperly Obtained Permit citation and possible UWS 18.06 (44) citation.

Each residence hall is equipped with Parking Information Boards, which are located by exit doors leading to the parking lots. Students are responsible for checking the boards for current parking information.

Commuter student permits are available through the Parking Department. These permits are valid in the commuter rows (row 8 - 11) at Ramer Field from 7:30am-4:30pm. If a commuter student chooses not to purchase a commuter permit, limited University metered parking and city street parking are available. To receive information regarding city parking, refer to the RFPD website at www.rfcity.org/police .

Display of the permit authorizes parking only in the specific lot designated on the permit. The registered permit holder is responsible for any parking violations issued to the vehicle bearing the permit. University employees are mailed applications for the upcoming academic school year in April of the current academic school year. Employee permits are assigned first by seniority status and then by office location provided the applications are received by the deadline set by the Parking Department.

Spaces for use by the physically challenged are identified in selected lots by Physically Challenged Parking signs. Spaces are designated in lots A, B, C, E, G, H, I, J, O, P, Q, QM, S, T, U, W and on the East Service Road. Vehicles must display a state issued physically challenged authorization or a Temporary University permit when using these spaces. Enforcement of these spaces is 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. Motor vehicles parked in areas designated for the physically challenged without proper plates or permits may be cited and towed at the owner's expense. A physically challenged parking permit is only valid in physically challenged spaces or in the meters, provided the meter is one hour or greater, without paying the meter fee. Physically Challenged Parking Permits are available in the Parking Department by submitting a letter from a physician outlining the necessity and duration of the permit requirement. They are not valid in regular parking spaces within faculty/staff or student lots. Physically Challenged overnight parking November 1 through April 1 is not allowed on frontage roads. East Residence Halls should utilize designated spaces in T and O lots November 1 through April 1.

Motorcycles must park in designated motorcycle stalls (located in A, E, G, O and Q lots). If all motorcycle stalls are full, please contact the Parking Department for instructions on where to park. Mopeds and motor scooters (under 50cc engine) may be parked in bicycle racks on campus, provided they are within the confines of the actual bike rack. Parking such vehicles on sidewalks, curbs, etc. next to the bike rack will be subject to a citation. Such vehicles may not operate under power between the roadway and bicycle racks. Operation off roadways could result in a fine of up to a $243.00 citation and impoundment. A permit is not required for motorcycle parking.

Vehicles left on University property without proper registration or a valid permit for more than ten days will be considered abandoned and will be towed and impounded at the owner's expense. If the vehicle is not claimed within thirty days of the letter sent out by local towing companies, the towing service will begin proceedings to dispose of the vehicle. When these proceedings have been completed, the University shall be absolved of all rights/responsibilities to the vehicle and the vehicle shall become the property of the towing service.

The UWRF snow removal policy is in effect from November 1st through March 31st each year. Faculty/Staff lots and service roads will be plowed first, followed by the main aisles in student lots. These actions are necessary to attempt to preserve access for emergency vehicles. Vehicles parked illegally in these areas will be towed at the owner's expense. If excessive snow exists in Faculty/Staff lots making parking impossible, contact the Parking Department for alternatives.

When it is necessary to plow student lots completely, students will be notified prior to the plowing date. Notices will be posted on the parking information boards in each residence hall, which are located by exit doors leading to the parking lots. It is the responsibility of the students to check the parking boards in the residence halls. Any vehicles remaining in student lots after the deadline will be issued a citation and towed at the owner's expense. Authorized alternate parking accommodations will be made and communicated to the campus community. In the event authorized alternate parking is full, it is the responsibility of the permit holder to find a legal parking space.

N lot is located in a floodplain and is subject to flooding. This situation will normally occur only when there is a great deal of rain in a short period of time or a fast snowmelt in the spring. The Public Safety Department will notify the residential hall staff via the emergency alert system when these weather conditions occur. It is the responsibility of the vehicle operator to be aware of these weather conditions and to be prepared to move their vehicle if severe conditions should occur. Vehicles should be removed from N lot and parked at Ramer in the commuter rows (rows 8 - 11) unless otherwise directed by the Parking Department. The Public Safety and Parking Departments are not responsible for any vehicles that are damaged due to failure to remove a vehicle. The Public Safety and Parking departments reserve the right to tow any vehicle (at the owner's expense) left in N lot should a flood occur.

If a vehicle breaks down, severe weather conditions exist, or a personal emergency prevents you from moving your vehicle, contact the Parking Department (715) 425-3333 during regular business hours or a Public Safety Officer (715) 425-3133 after hours. Specific rules and regulations apply for snow removal, please see the snow removal section of this brochure for further information. A vehicle cannot be authorized to remain illegally parked in disabled spaces, blocking traffic lanes, fire lanes or when it presents a safety hazard.

An overall undergraduate grade point average of at least 2.75 (on a four-point scale) or an average of at least 2.90 based on the last 60 semester credits (90 quarter credits) of the undergraduate program.

Developed in  cooperation with the National Community Education Association (external link), the UW-River Falls created this graduate-level certificate program in community education to meet this national need.

Under an agreement signed in November 2006, students in the UWRF certificate program may continue their community education studies and transfer 12 credits toward the completion of a MA in Education degree offered by Goddard College (external link).

Students will also present a portfolio indicating knowledge and application of Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction Standards for Professional School Counselors. Completion of the practicum and of the master's program is dependent upon approval of the portfolio by the program faculty and the practicum supervisors in the field.

The program is on a three-year summer cycle with a recommended load of nine credits per summer. One-credit application units are also available: research conducted during the school year under the guidance of faculty members.

Get the training, license, and scheduling flexibility you need without compromising quality. UW-River Falls has condensed its Learning Disabilities (LD) Teacher Certification program so you can fast-track completion of the requirements in just one calendar year, or take a second year to complete the program if you need the extra time.

We work with students to incorporate practica in a convenient time frame and placement. Participants who are not teacher certified are welcome, but will not be eligible for state certification as a teacher of specific learning disabilities.

This program was created to meet the most current standards of Wisconsin DPI for certification as a Learning Disabilities Teacher and is taught by UW-RF faculty who are experts in the field, and have experience teaching students with learning disabilities in a K-12 setting.

Students are required to take 24 credits (six courses) in core mathematics, six credits of course work in the College of Education and Professional Studies, and an independent research (Plan B) paper.

In the final phase of the program, a portfolio providing evidence of the skills needed to meet National Policy Board and Wisconsin Administrator standards is presented to a review panel of faculty and an area administrator.

Recognized by the National Education Association as having one of the best teacher education programs in the country, the University of Wisconsin-River Falls is uniquely able to offer relevant, practical, convenient, and high-quality courses in reading. The UW-River Falls teacher education programs are nationally recognized for excellence and are accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, North Central Association and the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI).

Students are encouraged to engage in reflective practice utilizing a problem-solving approach from a child advocacy perspective, to engage in preventive as well as remedial practices, and to work with a broad cross-section of the student population, including regular education students.

Wisconsin and Minnesota require that applicants for teacher certification, including school psychology, submit fingerprints with the certification application. In addition, criminal background checks are required.

This component is designed in cooperation with a faculty advisor. There will be opportunities to access research data from UW-Madison as well as UW-River Falls and utilize these data with selected students in special projects in the secondary school setting.

State certification standards are not identical for all areas of specialization, may vary from state to state, and may change for a given state. To ensure that standards are met, students should consult with an academic advisor in the College of Education and Professional Studies, as well as their content area adviser.

Intern teachers are licensed by the state in which they teach and are paid a partial salary by the school district. They are responsible for a partial teaching load and work closely with an established teacher for one semester. Because of this teacher-intern requirement, early and close liaison with the Director of Student Teaching is strongly recommended.

More than one million students participated in service-learning last year through the national Learn and Serve America program. When students are engaged in meaningful service to their schools and their communities, both they and their communities benefit. Educators across the country are discovering the rewards of incorporating established curricula with hands-on service projects to increase student involvement and enhance academic achievement, citizenship, and character development.

The University of Wisconsin-River Falls, working in partnership with the National Youth Leadership Council (external link), has developed a graduate-level certificate in service-learning. The program assists educators to understand, plan and apply service-learning methods in their classrooms and their communities.

The shared inquiry process is a learning method in which students search for answers to fundamental questions raised by a text, lecture or experience. Participants of shared inquiry learn to give full consideration to the ideas of others, promoting thoughtful dialogue and open debate.

UW-River Falls tuition rates are competitive with other public and private higher education institutions in this area. Minnesota reciprocity is available. For all graduate tuition rates, visit the web site at www.uwrf.edu/accounts-receive.

This option is designed for those seeking to apply their unique interests, knowledge, and skills to the benefit of their community. Working with a faculty advisor, each student develops a customized, experientially based degree plan allowing them to focus on a specific sustainability emphasis. Students can choose from community-based agricultural production, food processing, land use planning, nature tourism, or conservation/biology just to name a few.

Technology for Educators is a 12-credit certificate program, with three core classes and one discipline-specific elective. Individual classes within the certificate program can also be taken to satisfy DPI teaching standards or as graduate credits to fulfill personal or professional development plans.

Developed in partnership with Watchable Wildlife, Inc. (external link), this graduate-level certificate program will help conservationists, community leaders, and recreation and hospitality providers build the skills necessary to effectively preserve the natural resources of and generate jobs and revenue for their communities.

Flexibility. The program offers a modular structure, meaning that each course component can be presented independently as a one-credit workshop or seminar. Both degree and non-degree seeking students can tailor the program to meet their professional needs.

Each course within the Master of Management program has a specific set of objectives that contribute to the management competencies. In addition the coursework provides coverage of the AACSB perspectives: ethical and global issues; the influence of political, social, legal and regulatory, environmental and technological issues; the impact of demographic diversity on organization.

Two years ago, at the age of 62, Joanne Banks was diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer. “I realized that I was going to die a little young,” says Banks. “I thought it a very good opportunity to rethink my life, to think back on the past, and try to figure out what I’d like to leave behind...More.

Her life, she says, is a symphony composed of three key themes: A person has gifts that should not be wasted, relationships among people are the staff of life, and everyone has something to give back. More.

On November 7, 2003, the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents authorized a pilot program offering discounted tuition to the eligible non-resident children and grandchildren of alumni . Tuition rates for eligible individuals would be discounted to a rate equal to regular non-resident undergraduate tuition less 25%  but not less than the projected cost of that student's education. The student would continue to pay all other costs at rates applicable to other students. Participation would continue for subsequent terms as long as the student remains in good standing and makes satisfactory academic progress. The pilot program is to be effective with the Fall 2004 session and will run for a period of three years. After this period, the program will be evaluated and a recommendation made to the Board regarding continuation. The primary goal of the program is to increase non-resident enrollments thereby generating additional financial support for resident enrollments. It is also hoped that providing such a benefit will enhance development opportunities by strengthening relationships with campus alumni.

The program is open to students whose parent or grandparent graduated (with associates, bachelors, masters or doctoral degree)  from the institution the student will be attending . For purposes of this program, parents include biological, adoptive, step or legal parents and/or legal guardians. Grandparents are defined as the biological or adoptive parent of a person who has a biological or adopted child.

Signature of eligible alumnus attesting to relationship. In cases where the qualifying alumnus is deceased, prospective program participants are required to present the date of birth and social security number of the deceased. Institutions may, at their discretion, seek formal documentation to substantiate claimed status. Such documentation might include birth and/or marriage certificates, adoption papers or other documentation deemed appropriate.

The  25% discount under this program applies to the total non-resident academic fees normally assessed to non-resident students. It does not apply to differential tuitions, segregated fees, housing, food service or other fees which may be assessed to these students.

There are no limits as to the duration and/or cumulative benefit which may accrue to students under this program as long as the student remains in good standing and makes satisfactory academic progress as defined by the institution under US Department of Education guidelines for federal financial assistance programs.

Should the program sunset after its three year pilot period, students already receiving the benefit may continue to pay the reduced Return to Wisconsin rate as long as they maintain continuous enrollment and make satisfactory progress toward an undergraduate degree.

Institutions should make clear in any marketing or other communications that the program offers no preference with respect to admissions . All participants are subject to the same admission criteria as other students seeking to attend the institution.

Institutions must track the number of Return to Wisconsin applicants seeking participation in the program through data collected in the application process. A single question will be added to the undergraduate UW System applications asking students to self-identify themselves as potentially eligible for the program, i.e. that they have a parent, grandparent, etc. who graduated from the UW institution to which they are applying.

In addition, participating institutions must track actual Return to Wisconsin enrollments . This will be facilitated through information collected on the eligibility document detailed above as well as through "flagging" the student as a Return to Wisconsin Student on the CDR. It is anticipated that the CDR process will have elements added to note participation in the program and alumni relationship (e.g., parent, grandparent, etc.). Note that state of origin is already part of the CDR.

Finally, the Board of Regents expressed an interest in understanding the impact of the program on diversity efforts at participating institutions. Accordingly, institutions will be asked to assess such impact and explain how the program helped/hindered campus efforts to bring additional diversity to the student body .

Early in this decade, the Chinese government renamed a region in Northwestern Yunnan Province and the Tibetan Autonomous Region “Shangri-La.” The new name results from the government’s interest in boosting tourism in one of the more remote and strikingly beautiful areas of the country. The designation, “Shangri-La,” stems from the region’s superficial resemblance to the mythical Tibetan kingdom described in British novelist James Hilton's Lost Horizon (1933).

In addition to spectacular mountain ranges with peaks over 23,000 feet, the Shangri-La Region is traversed by three of the world’s most storied rivers running in parallel just a few miles apart—the Mekong on its long journey into Laos and Vietnam; the Yangtze, which eventually turns east and runs the entire length of China; and the Salween, which takes a right and flows into India’s Bay of Bengal.

In addition to breathtaking scenery, the region is home to 26 Chinese ethnic minorities—including Tibetans, of course—making it one of the most ancient, culturally diverse and intriguing areas in country, in fact, the world. China’s ancient Silk Road, documented by Marco Polo in the 12th Century, runs through the region and will be one of the byways upon which our modern travelers will tread.

The Blue Devils put on a late game surge to force overtime and an eventual loss for the Falcons.       Jontae Koonkaew led the Falcons with 23 points on 8-20 shooting. He also chipped in nine rebounds and four assists. Nate Robertson tallied 15 points and ten rebounds for sixth double-double of the season. Tim Pearson started and recorded 14 points and nine rebounds.

In  the first period she scored three times and had one assist. Her fourth  goal came in the third period. She also tied the school record for  points in a game with five. In the team's 2-2 overtime tie at Superior  on Saturday she got the lone assist on the game-tying goal that came  with 5:52 left in regulation.

Stefanie Schmitz set the pace for the game when she came out and scored the first goal of the day just 39 seconds into the first period. That was her fifth goal of the season and she was assisted by Jenny Schmidt and Jenna Scanlon. Finlandia answered back at 8:41 with a power play goal, but that would be their last goal fo the period. Schmitz answered back with a power play goal of her own, and her second goal at 9:45 with assists from Jessie Dyslin and another for Scanlon. Dyslin then scored a goal on a power play at 11:18 with Scanlon giving her third assist for the game and Schmitz also adding in the assist. Schmitz scored her hat trick and game winning goal of the evening at 19:07 with an assist from Jenny Wallace.

Finlandia made one final goal at 19:15 on a power play, but it was too little too late as the Falcons won 5-3.

Services provides classrooms accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The purpose is to ensure these students have equal access and opportunity to educational endeavors at UW-RF, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

At the UW-RF Disability Services, we don't attempt to automatically know what students will do ahead of time. In order to activate your accommodations, it is important that you inform us of the classes you will be/ are currently taking, and the accommodations that you want to use.

Thus, the notes you receive will probably be in handwriting. To have notes that are not handwritten your documentation must indicate why it is necessary. Because we pay the students who submit their notes to be copied, we expect the notes to be of high quality. There is absolutely no cost to you for this.

A.) Recruit a classmate yourself. Inform the classmate that Disability Services will pay to copy their notes, and ask the classmate to stop in our office so we can explain what this involves and make arrangements to pay them.

Accommodation is considered to be any tape recorded or CD version of a printed item that is needed for a class. This includes such items as textbooks, class handouts, and printed items from the university’s library.

Disability Services more than 15 minutes late to start a test my test taking appointment will be cancelled. To take the test I must then seek permission from the professor, who can probably legally deny my request. If the professor still wants me to take the test through Disability Services, I may need to submit another completed test request form that shows the new testing time.

For a possibility to have testing circumstances that deviate from those routines, I must seek and receive permission from the professor, and ensure the professor has explained the different circumstances on the test request form so the Disability Services staff can be aware.

Meet with advisees at least once each semester to develop a plan of studies, help interpret catalog statements regarding requirements, schedule courses, and evaluate progress toward meeting academic and career goals.

Letter of interest specifying: qualifications, and statement of experience, including ability to contribute to the enhancement of student awareness and appreciation of diverse cultures, Resume Unofficial transcript (official copies will be required for finalists) and Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of at least five references who can specifically comment upon your experience, professional preparation, and skills.

Strategies for Managing Your Time, Your Workload, and Yourself. A comprehensive compendium of information, strategies, suggestions, and advice designed to resolve the persistent or recurring time management issues commonly faced by experienced undergraduate and graduate university students.

Know the syllabus. The syllabus for each class details important information. The syllabus will explain the grading scale, give dates of tests, and dates when assignments are due. The syllabus allows you to plan ahead.

Know how many points you need to get the grade you want and keep track of every point you earn. Keeping track of the points you receive allows you to know how many points you need to get an "A." It also gives you a record of points you have received in case your final grade isn't what you expected .

Attend every class. Using your own notes is better than borrowing someone else's notes. You miss a lot by missing class. Professors also recognize that you are there everyday even if they don't take attendance.

Learn how to use the library. Ask the library staff to explain how to use the resources. You will be spending a lot of time in the library throughout your college career. The sooner you learn how to use it, the better off you will be.

Take notes in a spiral notebook, using a separate notebook for each course. Write your name, address, and phone number in each notebook. Write your lecture notes on the right hand page. Leave a wide margin on the left for writing probable test questions. Leave the left hand page blank. Later you will use the back of each preceding left hand page to integrate reading, lecture, and other notes while you are studying.

After each lecture, take several minutes to turn your notes into questions, focusing on the main theme and subtopics. Each lecture will usually supply three to seven good exam questions. The questions should be written in the left hand margin.

At least once a week, review the questions you have asked. Pretend you are taking a test, give yourself an oral quiz, or even better, practice by taking a written quiz. Then compare your answers with those given in your notes or textbook.

Instead of reading paragraph headings such as "Basic Concepts of Reading," change to read "What are the Basic Concepts of Reading?" These questions will become "hooks" on which to hang the reading material.

Look at your questions, answers, notes and book to see how well you did recall. Observe carefully the points stated incorrectly or omitted. Fix carefully in mind the logical sequence of the entire idea, concepts, or problem. Finish up with a mental picture of the WHOLE.

Strategic Planning Steering Committee is in the process of wordsmithing the 12 strategic goals in preparation for sending them back to the Faculty Senate. If approved by Faculty Senate the goals will be sent to work groups responsible for developing action plans. Egerstrom encouraged academic staff participation in the work groups.

Governor Doyle is budgeting $15 million for the Wisconsin GI Bill. $8 million will go toward providing 100% remission of tuition costs for veterans attending UWS institutions. UWRF will need to adapt its marketing strategy to these veterans and their families.

Tubr reiterated that there was definite support for a mentoring program, and he said he had asked the Chancellor how such a program might be administered. At the Chancellor's behest, he will be meeting with Human Resources staff on 9/25 to discuss whether that office would be able to administer the program.

Kathy Schultz updated the council on the findings of this report. UW System's information on usage does not match UW-River Falls' records. UW-River Falls' vulnerability in regard to reporting sick and vacation leave is minimal. It is extremely important for employees to hand-in leave reports each month. UW System is looking at sick leave to see if guidelines need to be established.

Mark Green, Republican candidate for Governor, said that if he is elected he will submit a TABOR-style budget, which could reduce UW System's budget by 1 to 2 % each year. Green has never been ahead in any polls while running against Governor Doyle. However, it is predicted that it will be a tight race with only a 1 to 2 point difference. If WI elects a Democratic Governor and a Republican Legislature, the budget process will take longer.

In the "Performance Goals" section, the employee and supervisor would discuss the performance goals for the employee, followed by an evaluation meeting in one year. The "Living the Values" section is more developmentally driven. The employee would complete a self-assessment and the supervisor would also assess the employee. From this assessment, the developmental goals would then be determined.

The old evaluation process was extremely complicated, and therefore, was basically abandoned. K. Schultz will make the suggested changes to these documents that the council presented and will forward the document to S. Egerstrom by the December 18th ASC meeting for approval. These documents would need to be approved by the ASC and then Chancellor Betz before they are implemented.

K. Schultz reviewed the new Criminal Background Policy. This new policy applies toward any new Classified, Unclassified, and LTE employees (not student employees). Previously, background checks were only performed for new Classified employees. These background checks will be performed by reviewing court records, dating back to 7 years.

Egerstrom is working with the Faculty Senate to send a postcard to staff asking for stories regarding healthcare coverage and concerns. A website will also be available. Responses should be submitted by December 8.

Jordahl remarked that there has been discussion for many years about enhancing academic staff orientation and development; however, Williams and Jordahl both commented that lack of time and resources has, by necessity, led to a focus on faculty and teaching academic staff. They also emphasized that they are open to discussing how to enhance the orientation and staff development programs. Egerstrom commented that non-teaching academic staff found some parts of the orientation to be relevant and some not. She suggested there may be a need for "peel off" sessions geared to these staff. Link thought it might be useful to send a survey to academic staff regarding possible topics that could be addressed. Croonquist offered to contact a colleague in Chicago who could do a session on diversity issues. Jordahl stated that no money would be available for a speaker; however, Croonquist said she would be willing to write a grant proposal.

Link added that institutional advancement grants have been used for this type of activity in the past. Acken Cosgrove also offered to do a conflict management session in August. On behalf of the Academic Staff Council Egerstrom expressed a willingness to coordinate a session for academic staff. Tubr thought a session could be created on best practices for mentoring faculty and staff. Williams said that the deadline for advertising the January faculty development sessions is December 10. Egerstrom said she would be in touch with Williams regarding the possibility of a mentoring session in January. Jordahl suggested that part of the session might focus on what a mentoring program should look like on campus.

Egerstrom announced that the Fourth Division had gained a fourth seat on the Faculty Senate. She mentioned that the other divisions are named after their colleges, and with the inclusion of the College of Business and Economics, there are now five divisions in the Faculty Senate. She asked the committee if Fourth Division was still an appropriate name for the division representing academic staff. The committee expressed a preference for Academic Staff Division or, as a second option, Fifth Division. Egerstrom said she would have a follow-up discussion with Wes Chapin.

K. Schulz presented the revised Academic Staff Performance Review document for the committee's action. She commented that, for the majority of the staff, the new document would come into use when the process of goal-setting begins for 2007. She also said the Human Resources Office would provide guidance on the use of the document. Croonquist made the motion to approve the document. Link seconded. Unanimously approved.

Human Resources would be willing to partner with the Academic Staff Committee to create and oversee a mentoring program. Tubr said research shows that more formal programs result in better outcomes. Bertelsen agreed and added there was a need for formal guidelines for mentors. Link thought it would be useful to have a panel discussion including people doing mentoring combined with a presentation on best practices. Tubr offered to do a session on best practices. Egerstrom will contact Ian Williams.

The Academic Staff Reps presented a card to Cora Marrett in appreciation for her comradery. Cora expressed what a privilege it has been to work with this group and the important role academic staff play in ensuring excellence in higher education. Cora also noted the importance in addressing the issues raised in the 2002 Report on Academic Staff.

The discussion of the Academic Staff Reps also included concerns about details of the plan and there was a general consensus that UW System institutions can't have additional students without additional resources. Cora noted that she would inform the President of their message.

On the election, Academic Staff Reps expressed their disappointment on the marriage amendment but they were pleased with Board of Regents (BOR) resolution on the amendment. Cora Marrett stated that domestic partner benefits are still a priority for the Board of Regents and are supported by the Governor.

The Academic Staff Reps also raised concerns about the Efficiency Group recommendation to transfer the $400,000 in Faculty/Staff development funds to the campuses. They were concerned that if the funds are moved to campuses, they would be cut.

Lisa noted Susan Rankin, a national expert in conducting Climate Studies, met with Provosts last month. The Provosts were very positive in response to the presentation. Curently a committee is generating plans for different models of involvement for campuses to determine feasibility, cost, and campus interest. Questions were raised about age and veterans' issues for a climate study. The Academic Staff Reps asked Lisa to share the campus Inclusivity Initiative contacts with them.

On the Compensation Advisory Committee, Al Crist noted the importance of this issue because of the challenges UW System institutions face in recruiting and retaining faculty and staff. The recommendations on compensation will be brought to the Board in December. The issue of compression and the affect it is having on people deciding to retire was brought up by the Academic Staff Reps.

On Criminal Background Checks, Al Crist stated that they are bringing the policy to the Board of Regents in December. He realized there is not universal happiness on this issue. Concerns raised by Academic Staff Reps included the cost of paying for these background checks and that this was overkill for a very rare problem. Al Crist stated that they are trying to minimize risk and costs ($20 average - $50 maximum), and that there is flexibility for campuses to exclude student employees. The question was also raised on whether criminal background checks needed to be done for all hires, and Al Crist stated that they determined that it was most fair to use for all new hires (with exceptions).

It is current practice to provide IRAS access to the above mentioned support resources, however, office space can be limited and timely access to e-mail and the Internet may depend on how often staff are on campus.

There are plans to implement an orientation where respective Deans meet with IRAS a few weeks into each semester. The intent is to provide information for new IRAS unable to attend orientation and for current IRAS who are familiar with campus but seek additional information.

While there may be opportunities for academic assistance within departments, there are no true mentoring opportunities for IRAS where they may address issues most effectively dealt with outside the department (i.e. personal development, department conflicts etc.).

Professional development workshops are offered to Faculty and Academic Staff at the beginning of each semester. There are also a variety of grant programs available, which are not based on title or longevity. There is some indication that the campus policy restricting all IRAS to contracts of one-year or less may discourage opportunities for professional development.

Faculty development grants are available for conference presentations. There is some indication that the campus policy restricting all IRAS to contracts of one-year or less may discourage exchange or leave opportunities.

As a campus policy, Academic Staff are not expected to participate in departmental governance, although some departments will allow some IRAS to do so. Approximately 75 percent of all IRAS have appointments of less than 50 percent, and restricting all IRAS to contracts of one-year or less may discourage multiple-year retention.

Academic Staff Council is the current governing body relative to all Academic Staff personnel issues. A Faculty Senate representative sits on the Academic Staff Council to provide faculty perspective. The current Faculty Senate has Academic Staff representatives as members to speak on academic issues. Both governing bodies allow for category A & B Academic Staff representatives.

B.10 If institutions do not have a single faculty/academic staff governing body, executive committees of the respective faculty governing body and academic staff governing body should meet on a regular basis to discuss issues of mutual institutional interest.

The current structure of the Academic Staff Council includes members from both category A and B. The current structure of Faculty Senate allows for category A and category B Academic Staff representatives.

Academic Staff and Faculty by creating a joint Faculty/Academic Staff Senate, but it was voted down by faculty. The one-year contract restriction for IRAS may hinder their ability to fulfill the three-year committment expected of members of the Faculty Senate and Academic Staff Council.

This gave IRAS the possibility of continued service to the campus and gave academic departments the possibility of retaining quality instructors for an unlimited time. This policy also offers maximum staffing flexibility with IRAS.

This current policy of unlimited one-year contracts is an improvement, though it would seem closer to the the goal of integrating? IRAS by making two- or three-year contracts available to departments when program needs clearly justify the position. This would give some support and encouragement to the instructor for doing a good job, provide for further integration as related to professional development and governance opportunities, and still provide for significant staffing flexibility.

Equity and Affirmative Action at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls is a multifaceted department committed to ensuring that all recruitment, retention, and other personnel practices within the University fully exemplify the best practices consistent with equal opportunity and enhancement of diversity in a positive and constructive manner.

Consistent with this commitment, the University is committed to creating an educational community which enhances student awareness and appreciation of diverse ethnicities and cultures and which actively supports tolerance, civility and respect for the rights and sensibilities of each person without regard to economic status, ethnic background, political views, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics or beliefs. Equity and Affirmative Action's mission is to encourage and support UWRF faculty, staff, and students in a professional environment to acquire greater knowledge, understanding, awareness and appreciation of diverse cultures and ethnicities and to actively support tolerance, civility, and respect for the rights and sensibilities of each person.

The University of Wisconsin-River Falls is committed to a policy of providing equal employment opportunity for all qualified individuals regardless of race, religion, creed, color, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, marital status, relationship to other employees, sexual orientation, political affiliation, arrest or conviction record, membership in the national guard, state defense force or any other reserve component of the military forces of the United States or the State of Wisconsin, or other protected status.

Equal employment opportunity applies to all faculty, students, academic staff, classified, limited term and project positions, and to all employment practices including, but not limited to: recruitment, interviewing, screening, hiring, certification, testing, placement, classification, evaluation, transfers, promotions, tenure, training, compensation, benefits, layoffs, non-contract renewals, terminations, retention, and committee assignment. UW-River Falls is committed to making every good faith effort to achieve the goal of equal employment opportunity through implementing federal and state equal employment opportunity/affirmative action laws, executive orders, rules and regulations and University of Wisconsin System equal employment opportunity/affirmative action policies and guidelines. Employment is subject to federal laws that require verification of identity and legal right to work in United States as required by the Immigration Reform and Control Act.

Affirmative Action goes beyond the concept of equal employment opportunity. Affirmative Action policies and programs are required to overcome the present effects of past discrimination and to achieve equal employment opportunity for members of groups that are or have been formerly under-represented. Affirmative Action policies and programs are tools whereby additional efforts are made to recruit, employ and promote qualified members of formerly excluded groups, even if that exclusion cannot be traced to particular discriminatory actions on the part of this University. Through specific and result-oriented activities the University's goals are to ensure that every person is given full consideration through equal employment opportunity policies and practices and to achieve a representative workforce through its affirmative action efforts.

The university annually prepares and maintains an Affirmative Action Plan* for the recruitment, employment and promotion of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. The Affirmative Action Plan details the University's progress toward affirmative action goals and compliance with all relevant policies. Copies of the Affirmative Action Plan are available in the University library, the Chancellor's Office, and Equity and Affirmative Action. A summary of the most recent plan is available on the Equity and Affirmative Action website ( visit site ). Copies are available for distribution upon request. The University Leadership Council and the Affirmative Action Advisory Committee are updated annually on the Affirmative Action Plan and also receive progress reports as needed throughout the year. The report also is submitted to the University of Wisconsin System .

UW-River Falls ensures physical accessibility to work environments for persons with disabilities and provides reasonable accommodation to ensure equal access to employment and all benefits associated with employment. When requested, reasonable accommodations for religious observances and practices will be provided.

Falls periodically examines all employment policies for discrimination and if discrimination is found, takes remedial action to correct the problem. All management personnel share in the responsibility for monitoring all equal employment and affirmative action policies. Evaluation of management includes an assessment of performance effectiveness in assisting the University in achieving its employment goals.

The Equity and Affirmative Action Officer serves as the Affirmative Action Officer and is responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of equal opportunity and, where necessary, the implementation of affirmative action programs. Persons seeking to file a complaint of harassment or discrimination should first bring the situation to the attention of their immediate supervisor. However, the employee may bypass their immediate supervisor and directly contact the Equity and Affirmative Action Officer.

Harassment is verbal or physical conduct that hinders access to employment; interferes with an individual's work performance; or creates an intimidating, hostile, offensive or demeaning work environment. Harassment by supervisors and/or co-workers on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, or other discriminatory bases are unlawful employment practices prohibited by state statutes, the Office of State Employment Relations, and UW-River Falls and will not be tolerated. Harassment in any form will be prevented and addressed in a way that eliminates its occurrence. Retaliation against an employee who files a discrimination or harassment complaint, or against anyone who assists in the preparation of or testifies on behalf of an employee, is itself considered a form of discrimination and will be treated as such.

The University's EEO/AA policies and procedures, including processes for the investigation and resolution of discrimination and/or harassment complaints, are detailed in the Faculty and Academic Staff Handbook and the Classified Staff Handbook. Copies are distributed to all employees. The Faculty and Academic Staff Handbook is available on the University website.

Through these policies and procedures, the University of Wisconsin-River Falls continues to reaffirm its commitment to the principle of equality of opportunity in employment and in education. While the University is obligated to develop and sustain a program of equal opportunity, we undertake these actions and adopt these policies, not only because we are required to, but also because it is right and proper that we do so.

Founded to promote and encourage students academically, socially, and culturally. AAA provides programming to the University community at large by sponsoring various events celebrating African American heritage. We emphasize leadership and scholarship through educational opportunities, service projects, networking and cultural programming. AAA welcomes all students with an interest in African American heritage.

This year's theme is built on the grounds of being scholars, leaders, and networkers. For each of these roles, a special activity exercises these themes. We strongly encourage everyone to participate in AASA. The association is created to serve and help students in retaining their culture and to helping them through college-academically, socially, and culturally. AASA welcomes all students with an interest in Asian heritage.

Promotes awareness of Latino culture campus wide through programs and events. Meetings offer educational topics and opportunities for off campus activities. LSO welcomes all students with an interest in Hispanic heritage.

American awareness throughout the campus and community. NAC offers programs, events and service projects to enhance understanding of the diversity that exists among the various Indian tribes. The Native American Council also addresses the challenges that face Native people and the contributions that Native Americans have given to American society and the world. NAC welcomes all students who wish to learn about Native American culture.

The Community Action Theater Troupe is a diversity eduction initiative coordinated by UW-RF Multicultural Services and the students from various cultural organizations on campus. The students offer the following programs, available for presentations at area schools: 1) Multicultural Reading Programs specifically designed for elementary school students, foucsed on harmonious living in our pluralistic society and 2) Cutural Programs highlight history, contributions and social customs of individual cultures within the United States.

As a participant you live and study in places such as Paris, London, Munich, Vienna, and more. You enroll in UW-RF courses, earning credits towards degree, and living in these foreign locations offers fascinating learning experiences that aren't available on the home campus, such as visiting key historical sites, speaking with locals about their culture, interacting with political leaders, and more.

In addition to group travel, you have plenty of time to see the sights and travel on your own. We expect you to explore the cities where we'll stay during the week, make some weekend trips to other places within the countries where we'll be based, and three weeks are reserved at the end of the semester to travel either independently, or in small groups. You can visit places, such as, Italy, Scandinavia, Ireland, or other exciting locations within Europe.

Prior to departure we hold several orientation meetings to prepare you for the semester, covering travel, accommodation, communication, money, and many other issues. We continue these orientations in Europe, and ITC staff are available to help answer your questions as they arise, both before we leave and while we are in Europe.

The benefits of studying abroad are unambiguously clear. You learn more about yourself and other cultures, develop self-reliance and other skills that can help you both in your personal lives and in your careers, make yourself more attractive as a job applicant, and much, much more. Students who have studied abroad comment about their experiences. Traveling and living abroad for several months is also an opportunity that is very practical as a student. Financial aid and grants are available, and traveling as a student allows you to tap into discounts that are unavailable to non-student travelers. In addition, after you begin work in the private sector it is very unlikely that you'll have more than a couple of weeks of vacation for years to come, and this is an opportunity to spend four months abroad while earning credits towards your degree.

Students from all disciplines are encouraged to apply and can usually apply the courses to general education, liberal arts, or other requirements (see separate listing). In some situations it might be possible to arrange independent readings, or internships.

Europe has wonderful transportation systems, including trains, buses, trams, and more. You don't need a car to visit most sites, and we'll talk extensively about different modes of transportation, costs, and so on.

We reserve spots in youth hostels. These are relatively inexpensive options for travelers that allow you to meet people from all over the world. They often have kitchens, internet access, tv rooms, and other amenities. The rooms are somewhat like residence halls or dormitories with several beds per room.

We anticipate that the total cost will be about $3,500 - $4,000 more than what you'll spend for tuition, fees, and basic living expense for a semester on the home campus. The cost is not fixed because you'll be able to control some of your budget (e.g., how much you spend on food, what type of travel arrangements you make, and so on) The figure includes airplane transportation, typical local travel expenses, insurance, and other basic items. Financial aid is often available to cover the additional costs associated with academic experiences abroad.

The UWRF campus job board receives active and open internships weekly. Log-in as a guest, or create an account to use a "Job Agent" to have a list of internships automatically emailed to you when they arrive weekly.

This database provides a unique and personal view of what it meant to immigrate to America and Canada. Our goal is to include more than 100,000 pages of personal narratives including letters, diaries, pamphlets, autobiographies, and oral histories, providing a rich source for scholars in a wide range of disciplines.

This order contains Federal affirmative action regulations for contractors and subcontractors. Each institution must develop a written affirmative action compliance program for each of its establishments and are required to transform the programs from paper commitments to equal employment opportunity.

The purpose of this act is to protect employees and job applicants who are 40 years or older from employment discrimination based on age. This act prohibits discrimination against a person because of his/her age with respect to any term, condition, or privilege of employment, including hiring, firing, promotion, layoff, compensation, benefits, job assignments, and training.

Title I of this Act states that no entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the individual's disability in regard to job application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, training and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.

Title II of the Act states that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.

A "qualified individual with a disability" is any individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies or practices; the removal of architectural, communication or transportation barriers; or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements of employment, receipt of services or participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.

This act reverses in whole or part several Supreme Court decisions interpreting Title VII. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 includes the following provisions: requires the employer to demonstrate that a challenged employment practice is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity; stipulates that a violation is established when discrimination is a motivating factor, even though other factors also motivated the challenged actions; and allows employees to challenge a seniority system allegedly adopted with a discriminatory purpose when that system adversely affects them, or when they become covered by it.

This act states that it shall be unlawful for any public secondary school which receives Federal financial assistance and which has a limited open forum to deny equal access or a fair opportunity to, or discriminate against, any students who wish to conduct a meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the speech at such meetings.

Prohibits the discrimination between employees of the opposite sex from receiving equal wages for equal work on jobs where the performance requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and are performed under similar working conditions. Exceptions are allowed in conditions of a seniority system, a merit system, a system which measures earning by quantity or quality of production, or a differential based on any other factor other than sex as long as there is no wage reduction of an employee.

Contractors will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The contract will take affirmative action to ensure this order and is shall include, but not be limited to employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship.

FMLA is designed to help employees balance their work and family responsibilities by allowing them to take reasonable unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. It also seeks to accommodate the legitimate interests of employers and promote equal employment opportunity for men and women.

Title VI specifies that any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance shall not exclude from participation, deny benefits, or discriminate against any person in the U.S. on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Affirmative action measures should be taken to assure equal opportunity and make up for historic and continuing discrimination.

This act states that the policy of the U.S. Government is to provide equal opportunity in employment for all persons. The policy prohibits discrimination in employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The policy promotes equal opportunity through affirmative action in each Federal department and agency. Equal opportunity must be an integral part of personnel policy and practice including employment selection, training, advancement and treatment.

Title IX specifically prohibits discrimination against individuals in federally-funded programs or activities, and in every aspect of employment because of their gender. Title IX provisions include prohibitions against male/female job-related stereotyping, sexual harassment, unequal opportunities for training, advancement and other benefits of employment.

Employees may not be harassed in the workplace based on their protected status nor retaliated against for filing a complaint, for assisting with a complaint, or for opposing discrimination in the workplace.

This statute provides that no student may be denied admission, participation, benefits or discriminated against in any service, program, course or facility of the system or its institutions because of student's race, color, creed, religion, sex, national origin, disability, ancestry, age, sexual orientation, pregnancy, marital or parental status.

The Agricultural Business Major is designed to combine educational elements of technical agriculture, business, and economics. It is a strong major for students who plan on working in farming or agribusiness where business and management skills are important. This major will help you develop skills needed for both entry level positions and for advancement in your chosen profession. This major does not prepare you for a specific job; it prepares you to effectively learn the specifics of a broad array of business related jobs found throughout the agricultural sector.

Students majoring in Agricultural Engineering Technology are provided with educational opportunities which combine an understanding of the biological, physical and agricultural sciences, with the problem solving skills of an engineer. Application of technical knowledge is emphasized as opposed to analytical and design aspects stressed in a professional engineering curriculum. Engineering technologists play an important role in the implementation of technical knowledge in a changing world.

Besides instruction in the physical concepts, courses include laboratory and practicum sessions that develop student critical thinking and problem solving skills. Students have an opportunity to work with the diagnostic equipment, measurement devices, engineering handbooks and computer software that are used by industry in problem solving.

The traditional Agricultural Engineering Technology option emphasizes technical preparation in areas of specialization such as: Power and Machinery, Structures and Environment, Soil and Water, Information and Electrical Technologies, and Food and Process Engineering.

The Environmental Engineering Technology option provides students with additional background in chemistry and the sciences. Besides instruction in the physical concepts, courses include laboratory and practicum sessions which develop student critical thinking and problem solving skills relative to engineering solutions of environmental issues.

Graduates with an emphasis in Mechanized Systems Management are able to combine their technical knowledge with management skills to effectively serve business organizations as individuals who are sensitive to the needs of customers and vendors.

The University often approves contracts with organizations requesting the use of college land for research projects. Those same organizations often employ college students to assist them in data collection and other activities necessary to conduct the research.

One of the greatest services the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences provides to the community is highly qualified students to local, regional and national companies for internship experiences.

College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Science has provided training in the agricultural sciences since 1912. It has earned an outstanding reputation for quality education and service to the people of Wisconsin. UW-River Falls operates two laboratory farms which are an integral part of the educational program. Many classes in animal sciences, agronomy, horticulture, soil science, environmental science and management, and agricultural engineering meet on the farm for the laboratory portion of the course. In addition to the production of crops, the laboratory farms support horse, beef and dairy cattle units, a swine herd and a sheep flock. Demonstrations and experimental plots are also provided for student use. Cropland and livestock production facilities are used for classroom and hands-on educational purposes. Modern facilities house the animals and are used to demonstrate the relationships between management, nutrition, breeding, and environment.

Located south of River Falls, the Campus Farm includes acreage for crops and houses dairy cattle and horse operations. Included on the farm is a pavilion with a heated arena for "on the farm" lectures, a dairy barn, milking parlor, horse barn, and a rodeo arena. A multi-purpose arena is utilized for livestock shows and sales, horse science course work, an indoor riding area & colt barn. FFA Career Development Events take place here as well. A six acre site on the northwest edge of the farm is devoted to agronomy, horticulture and forestry projects. These laboratory plots are used by students for research, observation, and practical learning experience. An intercollegiate rodeo is held each fall at the rodeo arena.

Rations for livestock are formulated and processed at the farm facilities. Feed processing, grain drying, and storage units are located at the Mann Valley Farm. The farm's cropland produces the majority of  feed required for  livestock production. An interdisciplinary composting research  program is  housed on-site.

In addition to an indoor classroom, an outdoor pavalion  is used for instruction, contests,  workshops, livestock shows and sales. The Mann Valley farm is the future site of a state-of-the-art Dairy Learning Center.

"Approximately $500,000 has been gifted by individuals, companies, and business to make this project possible," said Betz. "It's very clear to me that this initiative is part of the historic mission of this institution."

Kelm spoke of the excitement that faculty and students have for the new facility. "As a faculty member and chair of the department, I'm excited that we'll be able to use this new tool, but mostly I'm excited for our students," he said. "A project like this required a lot of vision and a lot of perspective and understanding of what this institution is about."

Kelm noted the key objectives of the new facility: to be a student-centered project, to address environmental concerns; to be a good community citizen, and to be cow-focused enterprise. "They are tremendous creatures that have amazing abilities," said Kelm.

Refreshments were served and attendees socialized after a brief program and when industry leaders, UW System representatives, UWRF faculty, students and administrators and community members overturned the first shovels of dirt for the center's new site.

The complex is expected to be completed by the summer of 2007 and will replace the old dairy facility, constructed in the 1950s, located at Lab Farm No. 1 near the main campus. It will include a compost bedded pack barn for approximately 100 lactating cows, a BouMatic double-6 herringbone parlor, which will increase milking speed and efficiency, as well as a special needs barn, calf barn, heifer barn, hay barn, feed shed and machine shed.

The facility will also feature a StepMetrix automated lameness detection system with sensors that will monitor weight distribution of the cow in order to identify lame animals; research bays with Calan gates, allowing the herd to be split into groups for nutrition trials, confinement and pasture-based management systems; and two 25-student classrooms attached to the milking center that can be expanded for industry-sponsored workshops and meetings.

UWRF is well known in the U.S. dairy industry as having one of the three largest dairy science undergraduate programs in the country with about 110 dairy science majors. In addition, the program has more than 450 animal science majors.

Chancellor Don Betz announced the award, which will be presented to the Chiefs organization at fall commencement on Dec. 16. Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Denny Thum is expected to accept the recognition on behalf of the team.

"The Chiefs are an excellent choice for this award," Betz said of the Chiefs presence at summer training camp in River Falls.. "For the past 16 years the team has been an important member of our university family. They have helped us to achieve many of our institutional objectives, including bringing more visitors to campus, increasing our economic impact on the region and enhancing our institutional visibility. The Chiefs have also been great partners to us on campus in other ways. Their presence has enabled us to offer dozens of internships to students, who have also found the Chiefs to be accessible, remarkable mentors.

"They've helped us to generate the resources to make numerous campus improvements. The team's leaders also have been outstanding advocates on our behalf to our state government in Madison, helping us to secure state funding for remodeling projects.

Chiefs President Carl Peterson said the team was pleased to receive the recognition. "On behalf of the entire Kansas City Chiefs organization, we are honored to receive this prestigious award from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. The university and the River Falls community have been outstanding hosts for us during training camp the past 16 seasons. The administration, staff and students of UWRF have always made every effort to assist our team in any way possible. We are pleased that this partnership has also been very beneficial for the university and its students. We thank the University of Wisconsin-River Falls for this honor."

The Outstanding Service Award was established in 1983 to recognize individuals or organizations outside of the university community who have made exemplary contributions to UW-River Falls through their support of the institution's goals and their voluntary efforts on behalf of the university.

Halada noted that the team's presence on campus has been a win-win experience for both the team and the university. She singled out a less visible component: the exceptional benefit to student interns. Through the camp's existence, more than 70 UWRF students have had internships associated with the Chiefs camp, while hundreds more have been employed as camp workers.

"The Chiefs organization has always been supportive, welcoming and very receptive to allowing our students to be a part of the camp activities. Many doors have been opened to our graduates based on these internships, volunteer and work experiences, and the relationships that have been formed with Chiefs and media personnel who have always been willing to serve as mentors and references for students."

The gala showcased scientific posters by students, staff and faculty that have been recently presented at national, state and local events and conferences. It also included research to be presented in the future.

Nancy Devine will begin her duties with the university in November. She is serving as the executive director of development at the University of Detroit Mercy, a campus of 5,600 students and one of the oldest private universities in Michigan.

In making the announcement, Chancellor Don Betz noted, "Nancy brings a wealth of successful experience in all phases of advancement to this important position. Her career clearly demonstrates an exceptional passion and effectiveness for encouraging support for education and a gift for organization and interpersonal relations. Nancy will be joining the University Cabinet as a senior leader and will work directly with our much appreciated UW-River Falls Foundation Board."

"I'm delighted to join UW-River Falls as the executive director of the office of University Advancement and president of its foundation. During my visits to the campus, I found its leadership, students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends to be welcoming and passionate about the university.

"It's clear that the campus is poised on the edge of greatness. It is an excellent regional asset for education and outreach in the St. Croix Valley of western Wisconsin. It's proximity to the Twin Cities metropolitan area will provide many opportunities for developing successful new relationships.

During the past three years, she simultaneously planned and implemented a new comprehensive campaign while strategically expanding the overall development program. Prior to her work at UDM, Devine was responsible for development, alumni relations, and advancement programs in non-profit organizations and higher education institutions, including the University of Minnesota and Arizona State University.

The chancellor added, "I know that we will be enriched by collaborating with Nancy and others as UW-River Falls takes its message to all the communities and people we serve and to the thousands of loyal alumni and friends. I am eager to introduce her to our university family."

When researching majors, careers, or graduate programs, it is always helpful for students to talk to someone who has "been there." Hundreds of UWRF alumni, faculty, staff, and friends of UWRF with varied majors and careers have volunteered to talk with UWRF students about their careers.

The Mentor Network includes alumni, graduate students and friends/employers of the UW - River Falls community who enjoy exchanging ideas, advice, and knowledge of career paths developed through their work, education and volunteer experiences.

Animal science is one of the most popular majors at UW-RF. Students take the basic courses in English, speech, social sciences, economics, biology and chemistry which are essential to any option in animal science. Basic studies in agriculture encompass courses in animal, plant and soil science, agricultural economics and agricultural engineering. In addition, the student also takes core courses in nutrition, feeds and feeding, genetics, physiology, animal health, and milk or meats.

The production option allows a student to specialize in farm animal production and management. Advanced courses in nutrition, physiology, biometrics and animal breeding complete these academic programs.

Two laboratory farms provide opportunities for hands-on experiences with livestock to complement classroom learning. The University farms maintain registered herds of Holstein and Polled Hereford cattle, registered flocks of Hampshire and Columbia sheep, a herd of crossbred swine and horses. Modern facilities house the animals and are used to demonstrate the relationships between management, nutrition, breeding and environment.

The curriculum provides an excellent "balance" of science-based classroom work and hands-on knowledge. A unique feature of the program is its nationally recognized young horse training program. In the training courses, each student is assigned a young unridden horse and under the direct supervision of a faculty member the student trains the horse in ground and riding skills.

The Meat Animal Emphasis of the Animal Science major utilizes the core disciplines of nutrition, genetics, animal breeding, physiology, meat science and muscle biology to enhance the production and profitability of beef, swine, sheep, and poultry enterprises as well as the processing and marketing of meat products from each of these species.

Mann Valley Farm maintains herds of beef and swine and a flock of sheep which give students the ability to observe management practice skills in practical situations.  The heated indoor pavilion on this farm provides the opportunity to conduct many classes, workshops and contests in comfort.  Valuable practical experience in animal production may be gained by obtaining a job at one of two university laboratory farms.  Students work with dairy, equine, or livestock enterprises supported by work study, student assistant or research funds.

The Block and Bridle Club is the local chapter of the National Block and Bridle Club which provides students an opportunity to develop livestock skills and to interact with others interested in the advancement of animal agriculture.

The Dairy Club caters to the educational and social experiences of students expressing interest in the dairy production and processing industries. Activities include fitting and showing cattle, a club-sponsored heifer sale, spring trip, and guest speakers at the monthly meetings.

The Falcon 4-H Club is the local club of the National Collegiate 4-H program. It promotes the ideals of the 4-H program such as leadership, communication, recreation, etc. Activities include: conducting workshops, judging 4-H events, assisting with various county activities, spring picnic, hosting volleyball tournament, and attending regional and national conferences. Falcon 4-H is open to all majors. Previous 4-H experience is not required.

The Food Science and Technology Club is a professional organization of food science majors and minors. Club activities include educational trips to food processing factories, smoked turkey sales, and attending regional and national meetings of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). Club members participate in regional and national competitions sponsored by the IFT.

The Poultry Club is an organization of students interested in all types of poultry. Membership includes students with majors across the campus. The club supports the UWRF Poultry Judging team, provides workshops on judging and showing for 4H and FFA, and attends Professional meetings for the poultry industryand does a variety of social activities.

The PreVeterinary Club is an organization open to all students interested in pursing careers in Veterinary Medicine. Various aspects and opportunities in Veterinary Medicine are explored through trips, guest speakers, and exchange among members.

The UWRF Rodeo Club offers students with an interest in rodeo an opportunity to experience rodeo and to those students with a history in rodeo to compete at the college level. The univeristy rodeo team is part of the intercollegiate Rodeo Association and belongs to the Great Plains region. UWRF hosts the first rodeo of the season in September.

The focus at University of Wisconsin-River Falls is undergraduate education. Emphasis is placed on how students develop through their educational experiences --- in classes, in labs, and in social situations.

This course covers the status of children and adolescents across the world, contrasting various societies in industrial and developing regions, including indigenous populations. Major topics covered are children and poverty, the health and disease status of children and adolescents, and children in war, including cultural definitions of children's rights. Co-listed as SOCI 211.

The course is designed for sociology majors or minors and anthropology minors who wish to pursue an anthropological topic of special interest. Students must complete an application and receive departmental approval before registering.

Most anthropologists work outside academia. For example, an archaeologist may examine a construction site for historical material before a building is constructed. A forensic anthropologist may work closely with law enforcement agencies investigating homicides. A biological anthropologist may assist minority women in maternal and child health care programs. A cultural anthropologist may work with African villagers to structure culturally appropriate social and economic development.

The individual trained in anthropology is skilled at working in multi-cultural settings or in organizations where diverse interest groups compete for resources. The student of anthropology learns how to work constructively with varied beliefs and behaviors.

The Red Cross will be on campus on November 15th and 16th for the Fall Blood Drive. This will be a two-day drive, so there will be a couple options to donate. On both days, the Bloodmobile will be in the River Room of Rodli Commons and will be open from Noon-6:00 PM. Everyone is welcome to donate your blood or your time. We are really looking for first time donors and people with "O Negative Blood," so please check us out.

Pro's Ice Sessions are times set aside for skaters and their coaches. The ice is closed to the rest of the public during this time. The sound system will be available. Coaches will not need to pay to enter the ice. Arrangements can be made to have  Hunt Arena Skating School  coaches available on an individual basis. There is a limit of ten skaters per contract ice time.

As an Intramurals supervisor, I have been disgusted by the recent amount of forfeits that are plaguing the Recreation Program. Over the past week there has been an average of four forfeits per evening.

This means that during the week, 16 games were not played and 32 teams were not able to compete. This number is outlandish! As a supervisor I wonder, "Why is this happening? What is causing this lack of participation and love for the game?"Intramurals is one of the most functional, advantageous programs that this campus offers. Not only does it provide students with an opportunity to be active and get in shape, but it also bestows students the chance to experience the camaraderie and ambience of a competitive sports environment.

COMMITMENT.I've heard gripes from teams about playing better competition. For example, one participant complained to me, "It's not fair that they have so many good people on their team. Is that legal?" Another person protested that the men's club volleyball team should not be able to be involved in Intramurals.RULE #1: NO FEAR. You never know when your time will come. It's fun to upset the best.For those of you who are consistently whining and making excuses, it's time to give it up and take it like a champion. Instead of carping about the ability of other teams, take it upon yourself to make your team more competitive. Plus, don't most inferior teams relish the opportunity to play a ranked team? I don't think that the UW-River Falls men's basketball team grumbled when they got the chance to play the Wisconsin Badgers in an exhibition game last season. Actually, for most of them, it probably was one of the highlights of their entire season, even despite the anticipated loss. To even be given that opportunity to beat a superior opponent is a chance that most others never get. Take advantage of it.RULE #2: LOYALTY and COMMITMENT always win out in the end. So, if you really want that long-sleeved t-shirt, you will learn how to exude these attributes.There are other teams who are forfeiting because teammates are not committed.

If you are on a team and not showing up, then why did you agree to be a member of a team? Knowing how to be a teammate is an important aspect, not just in Intramurals, but in life. A lack of commitment on an Intramural squad, impugns your ability to be a dedicated group mate for school projects or for future work assignments.During the end of this semester, I'm hoping that teams will get themselves into gear and start focusing on the actual effects of forfeiting. Forfeiting is selfish. Not only does it affect the team you were supposed to play, but it degrades the integrity of your team and our Intramurals program. My final advice: If you are going to join a team, make sure you can commit yourself to it.It's time for Intramurals participants to actually start participating and start "Living to Play."

I cannot even believe we need to discuss this topic. Hands down, no questions asked it was the team led by Connor Graves and Krista Hasselquist, the Ladybugs.  With a team of two girls and four guys, the tribute paid to the classic Rodney Dangerfield movie was amazing.  If you don't know what I am talking about you have been living in a hole.  The four men on this team we're amazing women.  I do not know who it was, but the one with the blonde wig was a real looker.  Nice legs.  Absolutely costume contest champions.

Graves really pulled together a squad of some of the best looking women that were actually men that I have ever seen.  As one Barbie Soine of the Champions Team Greeting Card said, "Dang! Those guys are better looking girls than most of the girls I see downtown on the weekend." And I would have to agree with Soine I saw a few of the spectators approach this team and ask for some phone numbers. Ladybugs hands down best costumes.

That is a loaded question. I am going to take the easy road.  One team will finish the season undefeated.  However, it will not be a team that has one loss right now.  You see if you lose a game, you are not undefeated.

Conversely, if you go through a season and you have some luck, and each game you score more goals than your opponent, and you win all of those games, then you have a season of perfection.  Perfection is hard to find.  There is only one perfect thing in this world.  That perfect thing is any quarterback in the Metrodome on Sundays.  So with that being said, yes there is a team that will be undefeated, and that team will not have any losses.

This team is loaded with talent.  This talent is seen in more than one place on campus, they are the "Cool Kids"!  This team"s first love is played on grass instead of ice where they are proven to be a great team again and again.  Along with the phenomenal teamwork that they display they are loaded with talented athletes, they have four All-Conference Soccer Players on their team in Julie Sperstad, Amy Jensen, Kim Saufl and finally the Intramural tested Ashley Peterson.  Peterson is in the ranks with the Intramural Legend Taylor Germain.

The only thing Germain has on Peterson is the supporting cast that will compete along side him in every single sport imaginable which gives Germain a much larger fan base.  With fan base out of the picture, in my opinion Peterson is much more gifted and deserves more credit for her attributes.  With Peterson as the leader I will stick my neck out unlike my counter part and make my prediction, The Cool Kids will be the only undefeated Women"s Broomball Squad come the beginning of December.

I am going to abstain from this voting, college football doesn't interest me, if you really want to see which team is better, bring them to Hunt Arena, give them broomball sticks and have them play any one of our teams in Women's broomball.  Ever seen a grown man cry?

This is going to be a great game, no question. Now I am obviously an Intramural Expert and have little knowledge when it comes to college football and the predictions that come along with this spectacle that is mostly high energy college students getting out of hand during the game and after.  I will go with the Troy Smith lead Buckeyes; he is the front runner for the most coveted award in college football the Heisman.

Scotland. The program enables students to study for one semester or a full year at Dalkeith House in Dalkeith, Scotland, near Edinburgh. Dalkeith House, a stately 18th century manor house, serves as the location for student housing and instruction for the program. Students earn UW-River Falls resident credits while taking courses from British and Wisconsin faculty. A program of study is offered each semester to meet the general education, elective, and some major/minor requirements of the enrolled students. The program is open to students who have completed their feshman year and are in good academic standing.

Each Fall Semester students have the opportunity to work on an individual research project in Europe and earn regular UW-RF credits. This program, the oldest continuing opportunity for international study in Wisconsin, began at the UW-RF campus in 1963. It is designed to combine the most significant aspects of foreign travel and research into a meaningful educational experience.

The program offers 12 semester credits and involves 12 meetings of two hours each preceding the semester abroad and three evaluation sessions of two hours each upon return. While in Europe, students begin with a week's stay in Paris, and then go on to do fourteen weeks of directed research and independent travel with major research being pursued in a European country. Further information may be obtained from David Heberlein in the Art Department in KFA.

The location of the station makes it ideally suited for field studies in the natural sciences, while the beauty of the area also facilitates the pursuit of activities in the humanities, social sciences, recreation/physical education, and other disciplines.

Lake. The lake is approximately 2 miles long and 1/4 mile wide at the maximum. The surface area varies considerably as the water level rises and falls, but it is generally close to 200 acres. Since the lake itself has no inlet or outlet, its major water supply is either ground water or seepage.

The ecological characteristics of the area are extremely diverse. Most of the forested area consists of regrowth, but there are scattered patches of virgin pine and hemlock. In addition, the site is enhanced by the existence of bogs, abandoned fields, cattail marshes, lakes and streams as well as numerous other aquatic habitats.

In this Web site, you'll find: details about our facilities, including regulations and maps; courses offered during the summer at Pigeon Lake; information for faculty and students planning to visit the station; fees for the coming year; and contact information for all UW campuses.

The Department welcomes and supports diversity in all its forms. Faculty and staff value a climate that is open and accepting, and make every effort to provide students with a learning environment that is free of harassment and discrimination.

The department offices, computer lab, and the student-run radio station, newspaper, and advertising group are housed on the third floor of North Hall. An entrance ramp and elevator provide accessibility.

"The new equipment weighs less, produces better sound, and can easily be upgraded," said Rick Burgsteiner, WRFW general manager. "We're very fortunate that WBA offers these educational support grants to help student broadcasters."

The UW-RF Modern Language Department, housed in the second floor of the Kleinpell Fine Arts building, offers a Major in Modern Language (with options in German, French, and Spanish), minor courses of study in Spanish, French, and German, as well as several courses in Chinese and Japanese. Our goals are the development of language proficiency and cultural literacy, as well as the training of high-quality modern language teachers. To achieve this, we maintain a constantly renewed set of course materials, use new and innovative technology, and pay careful attention to the development of students and faculty alike. Study abroad is an important component of our program, and the department administers the Winter Interim in Mexico Program each year.

We are a small department and we encourage close cooperation among the faculty and between faculty and students. There is an active club for each language, which encourages faculty-student interaction and takes advantage of the cultural diversity of the Twin Cities metropolitan area.

Our multi-media language laboratory contains computers with DVD capability, video and audio tape players, laser disc players, and a number of computer/video interactive programs. We have added many interactive CD-ROMs and language dictionaries to our capabilities and the lab has high-speed internet connectivity.

UW-River Falls Department of Speech Communication and Theatre Arts prepares students for challenging careers in the field of oral communication - from public relations, sales and personnel management to education, television production, and professional theatre as well as preparation for graduate school. We offer a major in Theatre and a major in Speech Communication with emphases in speech communication, mass communication, professional and organizational communication or speech education.

At River Falls mathematics is viewed as both the foundation for the sciences and a significant field of knowledge in its own right. Our mathematics instruction is dedicated to nurturing and developing students creative mathematical talents as problem-solvers.

The River Falls Mathematics faculty has diverse backgrounds and research interests, including combinatorics, differential equations, mathematics education , mathematical engineering, numerical analysis, probability, and statistics. Two courses which are unique to the River Falls Mathematics Program are Honors Calculus and Senior Seminar. Honors Calculus is a one hour course, taken in tandem with the normal calculus courses, in which first year students have fun exploring calculus in more breadth and depth.

The Mathematics Department is arranged so that many faculty have study spaces directly outside their offices providing an environment of easy accessibility to professors. The department supports a Math Study Room where students work and informally interact with one another, and a Math Help Center which is staffed with upper level students who can provide help and insights to students studying mathematics in their first two years.

The tripartite mission of the University of Wisconsin - River Falls Department of Psychology's undergraduate program is: (1) to provide students with an understanding of the content and methods of psychology, (2) to prepare students for a lifetime of learning and thinking by cultivating their requisite intellectual skills, and (3) to promote personal characteristics that are consistent with high ethical standards and a sensitivity to issues of culture, ethnicity, and gender.

The Broad Field Social Studies (BFSS) degree is the preferred degree for secondary teaching in the area of social studies. This degree offers many options and great versatility. The program requires that the student have a concentration (a major) in one of the social sciences and then additional work in the other social sciences. The concentration gives the degree maximum flexibility if the student does not continue in the field of education.

A minor in Women's Studies presents students with the following: past and present scholarship on women; a methodology which treats the experience of both sexes as equal in value and scholarly importance; and opportunities to conduct interdisciplinary research in women's studies.  The minor consists of a core unit and elective courses in many disciplines, for a total of 23 credit hours (minimum).

Information regarding short course preparation for the LSAT Exam is available via LighthouseReview, Inc This is not an endorsement of their program, it is simply meant to provide information regarding a service you may or may not want to utilize.

Most pre-medical students major in Biology or Chemistry because of the number of courses required in these areas but keep in mind that other majors are possible. "Pre-medical" is not a major on its own. Requirements for a declared major and minor must be met to graduate.

Students have the greatest success in applying to a medical school in the state in which they reside. For most UW-RF students these schools include the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and Duluth.

It is important that you plan well ahead for application and preparation for this exam. Information, forms, publications, tables, and MCAT writing sample items are available through the American Association of Medical Colleges Student and Applicant Information Web Page.

An excellent source of information of interest to pre-meds is available from the University of Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Medical Student Association. You may access this source directly at The American Medical Student Association.

The pre-dental requirements can normally be completed in three years but dental schools are increasingly preferring candidates who have completed the baccalaureate degree. If you are planning to complete the undergraduate degree, keep in mind that "pre-dental" is not a major and that requirements for a major and minor must be met to graduate.

"Additional courses in human-related biology and biochemistry are strongly recommended to furnish a broad foundation, and courses in mathematics are suggested in preparation for physics and advanced chemistry."

". . . students are encouraged to take the following preferred electives: art, cell biology, histology, human anatomy, microbiology, and physiology. These electives are especially important for persons who have completed only the minimum credits required (87 semester/130 quarter) to enter dental school."

"Additional electives can be chosen from among the following subjects: accounting, analytical chemistry, anthropology, business (practical courses), classics, comparative anatomy, economics, etymology, genetics, history, humanities, immunology, higher mathematics, logic, microscopic anatomy, political science, sociology, and a foreign language."

Association, must be taken for application to dental schools. You may take the DAT during the spring (April) of the Junior year or during fall (October) of the Senior year. Application for the exam is due approximately one month in advance. It is important that you plan well ahead for application and preparation for this exam. Extensive information, including coverage and registration for the DAT, is available on the American Dental Association DAT page.

These programs leading to a degree are available in such fields as engineering, law, medicine, optometry, and pre-veterinary medicine. Details must be worked out by the student and the advisor and approved by the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in advance.

It should be emphasized, however, that there are slightly different requirements for different engineering specialties and schools so a student should contact the pre-engineering advisor in the Physics Department as soon as possible.

The skill most basic to success both as an undergraduate student and as a law school student is the ability to competently use the English language in both written and oral form. In addition the student needs to be concerned with developing the capacity to think logically and to critically evaluate the knowledge gained through their courses of study. A pre-law program is relatively flexible and does not call for a particular major field or specific list of courses beyond those required by the University for the undergraduate degree. Students with law in mind should think of their pre-law studies as preparation toward a goal rather than a prescribed set of courses.

Add to these a variable number of credits selected to meet requirements of specific medical schools (for example, the University of Minnesota requires two semesters of English literature) and/or to fulfill academic major and minor requirements for a degree.

Most professional schools of optometry require up to 90 credits in a pre-professional program prior to admission. A few schools require or recommend a bachelors degree before admission. Virtually all schools require the applicant to sit for the Optometry College Admission Test (OCAT). Not all schools will require the following courses or some schools may require other courses that are not listed; check closely with adviser.

Studies, Geography, History, Political Science, Psychology, or Sociology D. Electives Variable number of credits selected to meet requirements of specific veterinary colleges and/or to fulfill academic major and minor requirements for a degree.

Students have the greatest success in applying to a veterinary school in the state in which they reside. For most UW-RF students these schools include the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. These schools have similar course requirements for admission. Application to other Schools of Veterinary Medicine is also possible.

Explore careers in veterinary medicine. Talk to veterinarians about the nature of their work. Engage in a job or volunteer position at a veterinary clinic or working with animals that demonstrates your interest in the profession. Gain experience working with animals and people.

The State of Wisconsin has established content standards that education programs are required to have in their courses. These standards are the basis of the Praxis II Content exams that all licensure candidates are required to pass prior to receiving a license to teach in Wisconsin.

This page provides links to the documents that demonstrate how the content standards are met in Arts and Science courses that are part of secondary education programs. To access these standards, go to the department and then find the link to the specific courses offered by that department.

The College also provides the basis for a solid general education program for all UW-RF students regardless of their area of specialization. In addition there are a number of interdisciplinary programs, including the Marketing Communications major, the Biotechnology major and the International Studies major as well as interdisciplinary minors in Ethnic Studies, Film Studies and Women's Studies which are all served by the College, as well as pre-professional programs in a number of areas. The College also provides high school and middle school teacher certification in the departments marked with an asterisk (*) on the home page.

The mission of the college is to provide for the education of the complete person, education for citizenship and leadership, education for a productive life and education for the love of learning. These are the primary values associated with a Liberal Arts education regardless of the discipline.

The college provides many opportunities for student involvement. Internship opportunities provide professional experience. Cooperation with companies in biotechnology, chemistry, geographic information systems (GIS), marketing, communications, etc. provide opportunities for students and faculty. We have an active program of undergraduate research and creative activity.

Languages (TESOL). We have excellent professional placement in journalism, which is the smallest accredited program in the country. Marketing Communications is a unique inter-disciplinary program. We are a state center for education in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We have a student writing series.

Our forensics team won the collegiate Division III National Championship in 2002. UW-RF is home to the Literary Magazine Review, a nationally circulated publication. The college also publishes "Prologue" to showcase student writers and it sponsors a student and professional writers series. We educate for work and for life through our excellent pre-professional programs with a strong liberal arts base.

Our semi-professional summer theatre has provided training and entertainment in this region for 35 years. In 2002, the UW Board of Regents approved our theatre major to take advantage of the talent on our campus and the vital theatre community in this region. Our major musical ensembles make annual international tours. UW-RF alumni work as artist/educators and professionally in all of the arts (e.g. graphic design; art gallery administration; documentary film and still photography; fabric, ceramics, glass, and pottery design; regional theatre; and the Metropolitan Opera in addition to positions in arts education).

CAS programs are strongly committed to interacting with K-12 school systems to provide current and varied content knowledge for students and teachers as well as providing the foundation for training future teachers. The college provides masters programs designed specifically to meet the needs of returning teachers by offering courses in summer institutes and in special settings like the Pigeon Lake Field Station. Departments sponsor a variety of activities throughout the school year including Advanced Placement Review Days, disciplinary workshops, speech and debate contests, science exploration days, and art and music events. These activities involve thousands of students and their teachers from this region every year.

Unlike the other awards in CAS which are given to an individual in each of the three divisions of the College, the Outstanding Service Awards are presented to faculty in three key areas of service: University, Community, and Professional.

"I'm particularly pleased with the selection of Stephen Swensen," says UW-RF Interim Chancellor Virgil Nylander. "I have known his parents for many years and they have played a major role in the growth of this university."

In addition to administrative duties, Swensen is the principle investigator of two National Institutes of Health grants, both from the National Cancer Institute. These grants support nearly 40 percent of Swensen's time and are valued at more than $4 million devoted to lung cancer research.

United States for both men and women. Swensen's research focuses on low-dose spiral CT screening to detect lung cancer at an earlier stage when it is more likely to be cured. He also is investigating the utility of biomarkers, including both genomic and proteonomic signatures of cancer.

Swensen serves as a member of the Board of Directors of a technology-based venture start-up company called TeraMEDICA, founded by a small team of Mayo Clinic leaders. The company plans to build the largest medical digital imaging archive available on the planet. Ultimately, the Mayo Clinic will become a digital and filmless enterprise with patient images available wherever and whenever.

Swensen is undoubtedly a leader in organizing people interested in the advancements of radiology. He has been the president of the Society of Thoracic Radiology, president of the Fleischner Society, president of the Mayo Thoracic Society, and currently is president of the American Association of Clinic Radiologists.

River Falls is Swenson's "childhood home." The Swensen family lived in River Falls for more 50 years. All six of the Swensen children lived at home for their undergraduate education at UW-RF. Swensen says that his family's "home-cooking" was worth sticking around.

According to Swensen, there's really no better compliment to the institution and staff at UW-RF, when his two parents, who knew the UW System and wanted the best for their children, recommended the University right in their backyard.

Swensen says sticking to his long-term goals and knowing he has the opportunity to make a difference in diagnosing and curing lung diseases and cancer by advancements made in CT scanning is what keeps him driven and focused.

The award was initiated 11 years ago and recognizes a UW-RF staff member who represents blue-collar, craft, security and technical workers, or a member of administrative support, fiscal staff and non-union represented workers.

They are nominated by their peers or supervisors and selected for success in fulfilling overall job responsibilities, participating in university service projects outside of their job and overall human relations skills.

Zimmer was hired to work full time as a program assistant for the art department and outreach and graduate studies in 1996. Since then she has been busy providing support for the art department staff, supervising art students in the art office and gallery, and working to make Pigeon Lake, an outreach field studies program, successful.

"Susie has been one of the key factors in seeing that Pigeon Lake moved from a struggling program to a successful operation," said Michael Padgett, art department chair and senior manager of Pigeon Lake.

Zimmer hires and supervises a large number of student workers in the art department and takes an active role in the art gallery. She deals with outside artists, speakers and gallery directors to ensure that visitors to the University receive a favorable impression, said Padgett.

"She is a friend and mentor for so many students who have made part of their life's journey through the art department," said Randy Johnston, professor of art. "She is often seen working late with a student on a grant proposal."

Zimmer also is an active member of the River Falls community. She serves as a board member for the Community Arts Base, leads a Tsunami relief fund, and sponsors an annual Habitat for Humanity fundraiser through art sales.

Employees, Zimmer lead a petition in support of a fair and equitable contract for University of Wisconsin classified staff. She spoke about this issue, at Nylander's request, to the Wisconsin Joint Finance Committee.

"He's an extremely outgoing, hard working and lovable guy," said Jantz. "No matter what, he was always there to lend a helping hand. I miss him right now as he's out helping everyone by serving his country. I think him for that and pray he comes home safely. There isn't a more deserving person, in my book, who has earned and deserves this award."

"I believe that the undergraduate research experience represents what is best about our great public university – providing top-quality education, while harnessing the knowledge and talent of the UW System to provide benefits for all," said Reilly. "Our long-standing commitment to fostering and celebrating these research opportunities has enabled us to teach and mentor some of the world's brightest young minds right here in Wisconsin.

"By conducting serious research as an undergraduate, these students and their peers across the UW System engage in 'real-life' training, and are prepared to excel in their future careers," said Reilly.

"The quality of research by our students was superb. During my university days, this was the kind of research you would have seen at the graduate level," said Nylander. "This is a remarkable young group of scholars and researchers."

Park, Minn. Their projects were titled "Development of a 3-dimensional cell culture system for the growth and study of epithelial 'pseudo-tissues" and "Morphometric analysis of 'tissue-engineered' 3-dimensional epithelial cell cultures."

For more information on the strengths of UWRF in the area of international development, please go to the UWRF link.

One project was the purchase of almost $5,000 worth of 41 videos focusing on Africa, Asia, and Latin America, or international conditions affecting these countries. Curricular material was also prepared for most of these videos, and consists of faculty summaries and feedback, a list of student questions for discussion, and a list of answers to the questions for discussion for each video. For access to the videos, the curricular material, and other information, please go to the web site http://www.uwrf.edu/library/media/idv/.

Other projects in the works include the development of a brochure about the Association for International Development, a Speakers’ Bureau on international development topics and a panel discussion by UWRF international students. As these and additional projects are developed, they will be described under the PROJECT link.

The Association will also maintain a list-serve, and all faculty and staff in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area, as well as those in the UW-System, are invited to join. This list-serve is now working. It will permit members to advertise upcoming events, grants, projects, and other useful information throughout the metro region and the UW-System. For more information and to subscribe to this list-serve, please use the LIST-SERVE link.

The Mission Statement of UWRF: Within the mission is the statement that, “The university offers students the opportunity to increase their global awareness and sensitivity to other cultures. It also has a continuing commitment to provide opportunities for students to live, study and travel abroad and to increase the number and diversity of international students on campus.” In addition, students are required to take at least one course designated as “Global Perspectives” as part of their general education or other programs of study.

The College of Agriculture, Food, and Environmental Sciences: Most less developed countries depend primarily on the agricultural sector as its source of development, and wise and sustainable agricultural development planning is essential. With one of the few Colleges of Agriculture, Food, and Environmental Sciences in the region, UWRF has faculty experts and active alumni who specialize in the areas of agricultural economics, agricultural education, agricultural engineering, animal and food science, environmental studies, plant and earth science, and geology. They also have a “Land Use Planning” program that focuses on rural development and agricultural issues. The College provides exceptional undergraduate education and related programs in agriculture, food, and environmental sciences to serve the people of Wisconsin, the Midwest and the world.

The College of Arts and Sciences: This College includes development experts in areas including geography, history, French and Spanish Civilization, anthropology, political science, and others. The college offers study abroad tours to Belize, China, Egypt, and Mexico, and plans are underway to expand these offerings. Information on other study abroad programs can be found at the Office of International Programs, http://www.uwrf.edu/international-studies/.

The College of Education and Professional Studies: The Mission Statement of this College is” to provide visionary leadership in the field of education; to prepare ethical reflective practitioners …. and to provide empowering professional development opportunities for regional educators. This mission is achieved using contemporary educational technologies to grow regional, national and international collaborations. The College offers an overseas practice teaching program, and while much of the student teaching takes place in developed countries, students can also choose from nine weeks in the Bahamas, Ecuador, Mexico, or South Africa . For information on other tours and overseas student teaching locations, please see the office of International Programs, http://www.uwrf.edu/international-studies/.

The International Studies Program: UWRF has had an International Studies Minor for several years, with numbers of students now over 100. Beginning in Fall 2005, we anticipate having an International Studies Major as well. Enthusiastic support comes from faculty teaching the courses, the deans of the colleges, and the vice chancellor’s office, and most importantly, the director of the program. An international studies committee works with director to assure a high quality program. For more information, please go to http://www.uwrf.edu/international_studies/.

The Office of International Programs: This office has responsibility for UWRF students who wish to study abroad and for foreign students who wish to study at UWRF. The director of international programs works with the international programs committee, whose members include the international coordinators for each college, in order to assure high quality study abroad programs as well as other internationally-related projects(such as International Awareness Week and the International Bazaar). International students come from a range of less developed countries, including India, Thailand, Laos, Somalia, Togo, Rwanda, and Sudan. Our study abroad locations, in addition to some of the standard European locations , include Uganda, Belize, China, Egypt, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. For more information, please go to http://www.uwrf.edu/international-programs/.

Summer: Uganda Tour - The objective of this International Study Tour is to provide our students a great opportunity to acquire new knowledge, awareness and experience of global issues by focusing on an African country. This tour will expose the students directly to a different culture, business and economic environment, political systems, education, agriculture and environmental issues relating to Africa in general, and Uganda in particular. This study tour provides students, faculty, and the public a unique opportunity to increase their knowledge of global issues by traveling to, studying, and doing research on topics of interests relating to Africa. Most recently, the Director of the Uganda tour received a UW-System Institute for Global Studies grant to include the participation of a faculty member in the Geography Department in order to further extend the interest in the program among students. For more information, see the web page of the Office of International Programs on the UWRF web site, http://www.uwrf.edu/international-programs/.

Tour - The Belize study tour is unique, for nowhere else this close to home can students immerse themselves in such astonishing biological and cultural diversity. The group will be based at a jungle lodge for six days, venturing out to climb classic Mayan temples, float rivers, explore caves, hike jungle trails, and observe tropical wildlife unparalleled in the northern hemisphere. A day trip is planned to Guatemala to witness fabulous Tikal. All activities are led by experienced guides, educators, or researchers who teach students about Belize history, geology, flora and fauna, cultural traditions, and the remarkable conservation-first posture that guides Belize’s approach to sustainable development. The goal of the study tour is to increase each student’s appreciation of the importance of the conservation of bio-diversity. Belize protects its lands, its wildlife, and its marine environments. In doing so, the government, private sector, and public together strive to achieve a balance between the needs of people and the needs of the ecosystem. Each visitor to Belize is a witness to the special bond being created among all of nature’s beings.

J-term (Semester Interim): China Tour - History, Transformation of Traditional Society, and Globalization. This tour provides participants with an opportunity to study one of the oldest and most continuous civilizations in the world. Students can fathom the impact of modernization and globalization on Chinese traditions. It will last for 19 days during which the members of the tour will visit Beijing, Qufu, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Xian, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and  Hong Kong. Some of these cities can reveal to the visitors the deep-rooted Chinese traditions of political unity, Confucianism, social hierarchy, and elite culture.

We are delighted to have new members on the list-serve. It presents an opportunity to all of us to share information about conferences, guest speakers, our research and consulting opportunities, and anything related to economic development in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and East Europe.

Just as a suggestion: since people from UWRF as well as other institutions will be using the List-Serve, it may be useful to refine our subject lines. We might use the following system of capital letters: INTERNAL (for strictly UWRF business that no one else is interested in) and OUTREACH (for any kind of information that is intended to go to all list-serve members). Of course, we are all welcome to read and respond to every message, but some people may wish to immediately delete the message depending on the subject line. We can also add specific information on the subject line.

It is the policy of the Board of Regents that the facilities of the University are to be used primarily for purposes of fulfilling the mission of teaching, research, and public service. University facilities are not available for unrestricted use for other purposes.

University departments and recognized campus organizations may use University facilities for revenue producing activities, but may be charged for direct overhead costs such as utilities, special equipment, and labor to ensure that the University is not subsidizing the event.

Sponsorship or invitation by a University department/organization is required for the use of any University space by persons or groups from off campus. Off-campus groups are responsible for the direct costs and rental fees incurred with the facility being used. The University department or organization that is sponsoring an off-campus group is required to be directly involved with the planning, facilitation and monitoring of the event. Individual faculty or staff members associated with the University cannot sponsor an off-campus group.

Once an off-campus group has received sponsorship, the group must enter into a contract with the University through the Director of Conference and Events. This contract will delineate all terms of the agreement including insurance requirements, food requirements, parking arrangements, facility usage, compensation, waivers, and other considerations unique to the event. All contracts will be signed by the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance.

If a University department or recognized student organization desires to use University facilities for a fund raising event, they shall pay for utilities and overhead directly associated with the event.

This charge shall be either paid for directly or deducted from their revenue. The remaining revenue belongs to the organization sponsoring the event and does not need to be deposited in a State account.

A University department or organization may serve as a sponsor for a fund raising event by an organization not affiliated with the University. Sponsorship, as in 3.2, does not release the off-campus organization from the responsibility of signing a contract and paying rent and fees to the University. After a contract is signed and rent and fees are assessed, the off-campus organization may keep all revenues received as a part of the fund raising effort. Revenues do not need to be deposited in a State account.

If a recognized student organization is sponsoring a fund raising program and SUF money is used to pay for the entertainment, the receipts for the event shall reimburse the cost of the entertainment and utilities with the remaining revenues reverting to the student organization. If no SUF money is used, the student organization will only need to reimburse the University for the cost of utilities and other direct costs, so that the University is not subsidizing the fund raising event.

If a political candidate or a political party wants to hold an event on campus (meeting, get acquainted session, press conference, campaigning) and it is not at the invitation of the Chancellor or Director of Public Affairs, a contract and rental fee must be established.

Republicans can sponsor political events such as an "information table" or "get acquainted meeting" in the Student Center without a facility rental or contract. However, the use of other buildings on campus will require a University contract and rental fee.

The only exception is for residence halls, dining halls or lounges that are considered a "residence" for students. Student groups must go through the Residential Living Committee to secure approval for such a use.

Regents to ensure maximum access to public events held in University facilities consistent with the legally recognized rights and interests of performers, lecturers, artists and speakers. When an organization has secured the use of University facilities for a public event, any contemplated restriction or condition on access to the event must be made known prior to the event and must be embodied in a written agreement with the institution, which shall be open to public inspection. However, such agreements may not deny or restrict access to university facilities in a manner contrary to other applicable laws or regulations or on any basis prohibited by law.

Welcome to the Department of Biology home page. The department prides itself on the diversity of training, research experiences, and interests of its faculty members, ranging from molecular biology to ecology, as well a commitment to individualized student attention. Our department is located in the Agriculture-Science Building.

Mission Statement The mission of the Biotechnology Program at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls is to provide its students with an education that establishes a strong foundation and appreciation for understanding developments in the rapidly advancing field of biotechnology, to develop the technical and critical thinking skills necessary for success in the field, to foster ethical behavior, and to promote outreach.

The field of modern biotechnology was born of molecular biology and biochemistry. Modern Biotechnology provides a set of tools that allow scientists to modify and harness the genetic capabilities of organisms. This has led to rapid advances in many areas including pharmaceutical development, agriculture, food microbiology, medical devices and environmental sciences.

Some examples of the products of biotechnology include herbicide, drought and insect resistant crops, drugs targeted specifically to disease processes resulting in fewer side effects, and bioremediation capable of removing greater amounts of environmental toxins at reduced cost.

The Biotechnology major at UW-RF is an interdepartmental program with an emphasis on the molecular basis of life and the techniques utilized to study and control these processes under in vivo, in vitro, and commercial production conditions. The Biotechnology curriculum is an integrated sequence of courses selected from the curricula of the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Animal and Food Science, and Plant and Earth Science. It includes both traditional offerings of the departments involved and courses that reflect advances in biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology. The Biotechnology major is designed to provide students interested in pursuing careers in this rapidly expanding field with the academic background required to either secure entry level positions in industry or to continue their education in graduate or professional schools. A student may complete a B.S. degree in Biotechnology in the College of Arts and Sciences or the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences.

River Falls and the firm recently undertook several new testing contracts for international firms. BioDiagnostics relocated to a River Falls industrial park to take advantage of the proximity to the UW-River Falls Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences.

The skills and techniques learned in the program have served to enhance the career opportunities made available to me in the industry. I believe the biotechnology program at UW-RF provided me with an education and experiences superior to those from much larger universities. I would gladly hire any graduate of UW-RF that would like to work at Medarex, Inc."

Moving forward with biotechnology Efforts to attract biotechnology firms to western Wisconsin from the Twin Cities and surrounding states led to a resent visit to UW-River Falls by representatives of Forward Wisconsin. Forward Wisconsin, a unique public-private marketing firm, is a not-for-profit organization responsible for out of state business marketing and attraction of new business to Wisconsin.

The primary mission of the College of Business and Economics is to meet the needs of its stakeholders with high quality undergraduate programs, a Masters of Management program, and business outreach services to the St. Croix Valley region. Our programs are grounded in the liberal arts tradition and include the application of business and economics knowledge through the integration of the classroom and the community.

For formal admission to the College of Business and Economics, an admission form must be completed and returned to the CBE Office (124 South Hall) by March 1 for Summer or Fall admission or by October 1 for Spring admission. (Admission forms are available in the CBE Office.) Formal admission to the College of Business and Economics will allow you to register for upper division courses in your major. You will receive written notification regarding the decision of your application.

Bulletin Board in the hall outside the CBE office (124 South Hall). Internship opportunities are also announced in upper level major courses, as well as posted on the CBE Undergrad Communication D2L site. Many students locate their own internship. The majority of internships are completed over the summer.

If you have located an internship, please read the guidelines below and complete the application . You can complete the Internship Application electronically, but there are additional items that need to be turned in before the Internship Application is reviewed and approved. Go to the process link for further instructions.

College of Business and Economics students interested in completing an internship should review the internship site to ensure they meet the prerequisites for the internship program and become familiar with the internship process.

The Internship Coordinator can provide guidance and will attempt to match students with available internship opportunities. In either case, the Internship Coordinator and the student's Department Chair will make an initial determination if the job meets the stated requirements to qualify for internship credits.

The student must submit a periodic report to the Internship Coordinator upon completion of 40 hours of work, and for every 40 hours completed thereafter. Periodic reports can be submitted electronically through the College of Business and Economics internship page.

The employer will submit an evaluation of the student’s efforts at the end of the internship. The report shall consist of an evaluation of the student’s progress, performance, and contributions while working for the sponsoring organization. The Internship Evaluation Form is available on-line.

The student will complete a maximum three-page, double-spaced typed report summarizing the internship experience. An explanation of how the internship related to academic course work must be included in this final report.

The internship program is designed as a learning experience. Therefore, the job content should reflect this goal. Job rotation, responsibility for special projects, or assisting a manager in his/her duties are all possible examples of a significant learning experience. Other considerations include scope of learning experiences, formal training, level of analysis, and decision-making. A workplace setting with structure and mentoring possibilities is generally expected.

Proper supervision of the student should be provided by the sponsoring organization. The student should have an individual within the company to resolve an questions or problems as they arise. Guidance is an important factor. The student is also encouraged to discuss any problems with the Internship Coordinator.

FTE numbers are based on the number of credits taken in a semester. For example, grads with more than 12cr. and undergrads with more than 15cr. are considered one person. Undergrads and grads with less than that are considered .5 of a student.

Provides the full report on the purpose of the project, the methodology for data collection, recommendations for future audits, analysis of the data, and a discussion and conclusion about what I learned while conducting this audit.

Today, universities are the leaders in teaching environmentally responsible ethics and practices. However, few universities have applied their teachings to their own actions and have aggressively implemented environmentally ethical policies and procedures. Conducting a campus environmental audit is the first step toward increasing awareness and teaching the campus community about environmental responsibility and how it can shape a campus into a sustainable, resource-conserving, highly desired and cost-effective community.

I anticipate many possibilities for the future. I envision widespread use of alternative energy sources and a reduction in energy and water consumption. Other universities are beginning to realize the benefits of incorporating energy-reduction measures and recycling practices. In addition to helping increase awareness, an environmental audit serves as a valuable managerial tool that can help analyze programs and outline opportunities for improvement. When used as a management tool, the audit provides critical planning information that can be used by individual departments or by a larger team of people.

When conducting an environmental audit, one of the first challenges is the essential, yet painstaking, step of unearthing background information and compiling basic usage data. To start, I decided to audit UW-RF using the Campus Environmental Audit Response, (Campus Ecology; Smith, 1993). The Campus Environmental Audit Response is a questionnaire that asks basic questions about the University's various systems and their past and present environmental state.

By tweaking the Campus Environmental Audit Response questionnaire for this campus, I was able to gather useful data and focus on specific systems. This form, which I call the University of Wisconsin River Falls Campus Environmental Audit Questionnaire (CEAQ), serves as a roadmap of the various systems at the University, including energy, water and solid waste, thereby providing a benchmark for future environmental audits. The purpose of this audit is to be long-lasting and continually updated, so future CEAQs will be completed by the ESM 220 class in the Plant and Earth Science Department at UW-River Falls. The ability to continually update the environmental audit is the single most important element to achieve its ultimate objective: act as an environmental report card for UW-RF. Those who wish to present alternative ideas or comments for implementing changes to current campus practices, policies and systems can also use this information for years to come. Positive change, based upon the data collected in the CEAQ, will keep UW-RF on an environmentally sustainable path.

By providing historical data on solid waste generation, and electricity and water consumption, I eliminated the most difficult groundwork for future environmental audits. By providing campus and community contacts, making recommendations for future audits, and providing various resource usage charts and enrollment statistics, there will be a functional campus audit template in place for future students, faculty, and staff to work from.

Utilities, who specialize in each of the campus systems. I acknowledge those who assisted me at the top of each relevant section of the CEAQ and at the bottom of the charts in which they provided information.

If auditors can find merit in what it is they are looking at auditing, then it should be respected. I encourage anyone who has an interest in auditing any part of the UW-RF's campus to e-mail Kelly Cain to see how you can help.

This is just a few of the trends one can find when looking at the data from audits of the respective systems. No matter what the system being audited, you cannot dismiss the importance of data to show what is happening. This data is valuable as a decision-making tool for campus facilitators and should aid them when deciding which campus systems deserve updating.

When I first began to work on this project, I only had a listing of questions from Web sites and Campus Ecology to use as a guide for obtaining information. The methodology to be used was specific to each school I looked at and had to be revised for UW-River Falls as I went along.

Recognizing that I would be approaching a large number of people who would undoubtedly be busy already, I was somewhat skeptical as to how successful I would be at getting everything I needed. Much to my surprise, my requests were almost always met with as much enthusiasm about the project as I tried to have, and the information was made readily available. The support shown by Manville Kenney and Tim Thum of Campus Engineering and Carl Gaulke of River Falls Municipal Utilities was tremendous.

Creating an effective environmental database does not end with the collection of basic information about various systems found within the University environment. Rather, the CEAQ has set benchmarks in the compilation of this kind of data at UW-River Falls.

Kansas City's 2007 training camp on the River Falls campus will mark the 17th consecutive year the Chiefs have conducted their preseason work in Western Wisconsin. The team has three remaining one-year options in its existing agreement with UW-RF should the Chiefs wish to exercise them.

"On behalf of the entire Chiefs organization, we're delighted to return to the University of Wisconsin - River Falls for a 17th consecutive year," Peterson commented. "We have enjoyed our relationship with UW-River Falls and look forward to continuing that partnership for another year. I want to personally thank the entire River Falls community and particularly the staff at UW-River Falls for making training camp so productive for us the past 16 years. They have never become complacent and have worked diligently to improve each year."

"We're very pleased that the Kansas City Chiefs will be returning to UW-River Falls for a 17th year next summer," UW-River Falls Chancellor Don Betz commented. "This has been a positive relationship for the Chiefs, the University and the St. Croix Valley of Wisconsin. Having the Chiefs on our campus each year is an event that everyone looks forward to with anticipation.

"Youth football is the lifeline to the NFL, hopefully we'll see one of you in the league someday," said Thum.

Wyman was associated with public higher education for more than six decades that began in 1932 at the State Teacher's College in River Falls. During those decades Wyman served River Falls and Wisconsin higher education as a professor of history, scholar, author, publisher, administrator and benefactor.

His many accomplishments and legacies included serving as President of the Wisconsin State University at Whitewater; founding the UW-River Falls University Press; authoring 23 books chronicling the pioneers of Wisconsin and the Midwest; and donating the proceeds of his books and his estate to UW-RF.

"Walker Wyman was a remarkable person. He was a master teacher, a prolific publisher, and a wonderful mentor to his students and to his colleagues. He had a real love for this campus. Achieving the naming of this building for Walker Wyman is one of the high points of my career through 15 years of service here as chancellor; that is how strongly I feel about this," Thibodeau said.

The National Education Association cited the College as one of the 10 most innovative teacher education programs in the nation for its field-based experiences for student teachers in partnership with surrounding school districts and for its use of technology in teacher training.

Last year the College was honored nationally for in excellence in the use of technology by the American Association of Teacher Education and Microsoft. That recognition was based on its partnering with the River Falls, Hudson and Prescott school districts and St. Bridget's School in River Falls to expand the use of technology as a teaching tool in K-12 classrooms.

Wyman, at the time of his death in March 1999 at the age of 91, had recently published his 23rd book, "Great Legends and Stories of Mid-America." He was a contributing author to many other books, in addition to publishing scores of scholarly works and publications.

During his tenure, more than 3,000 persons were added to the student body and 20 new buildings were completed or started. The campus mall there is named in his honor.

Wyman's contributions earned him numerous accolades, including designation as the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents "Centennial Distinguished Professor of History." At UW-River Falls his support of the arts is memorialized through the Wyman Performance Series named for Wyman and his wife Helen, who illustrated many of his books.

He received an honorary doctorate of laws from Illinois State University; an Award of Merit from the Western History Association for his distinguished contributions to the cause of western history; an Outstanding Educator award from the Wisconsin Association of School Administrators; and was a Distinguished Professor of History at UW-RF.

Halls with new furnishings are Johnson, May, Prucha, South Fork Suites, Crabtree and West Hathorn. Homemade or rented lofts are not needed and not allowed in rooms with new furniture, bunkbeds, or temporary extended housing. New mattress dimensions are 80" x 36".

The charge for your residence hall room appears on your university account.  If you change rooms where your billing amount would be different (for example, moving from a double room to a suite) or leave campus, the weekly prorated amounts appear on your university account.  Further information about university accounts is available on the Accounts Receivable and Cashiers Office site.

If the request is to commute from the home of a parent or legal guardian living within an approved commuting district, pick up a commuter request form at the Residence Life Office in University Center.  If you are an incoming student, a commuter application is also available online. You may only commute from the home of a parent or guardian, not a sibling or other relative.  The completed commuter request must be signed by the student and a parent and the parent signature must be notarized and then submitted to the Residence Life Office, University Center.  If you currently have a housing contract and are approved for commuting, the $100 housing deposit will be forfeited.

If the request is denied, the letter will outline the appeal process, including how to contact the Chair of the Residential Living Committee, a student committee that hears all exemption appeals.  The student will be required to schedule an exemption appeal before a regularly-scheduled Residential Living Committee meeting, normally held every two weeks.  The decision of the committee will be returned to the student by letter.

At the beginning of each fall term we anticipate having over 100% occupancy. When all of our regular residence hall rooms are filled, we place students in extended (temporary) housing. Students placed in extended housing will receive adequate furniture (one bed per person and shared dressers, desks, tables and chairs) for their needs. Extended housing spaces may be in lounges or other locked and secure areas of residence halls that comply with living regulations. We realize this is a slight inconvenience and you will receive a small credit back to your university account for time living in extended housing.

Unfortunately, some of our current freshmen and sophomores enter into lease agreements with off-campus landlords. They do this without first requesting and receiving approval for exemption from the university housing requirement. They later apply for an exemption and their requests are denied because they do not meet the requirements outlined in the contract. The majority of housing exemption requests received are denied. We caution students not to place themselves in such situations.

If you meet the requirements, you must contact your hall manager, who will provide paperwork explaining the process of checking out of the residence halls. Your housing deposit will be forfeited if you break an annual housing contract, and you will receive a pro-rated amount back on pre-paid housing fees in your university account.

Individuals may choose their own roommate and must inform the hall manager within two (2) days so they are not put in the consolidation process (this move must take place within seven (7) working days).

Individuals who have not notified the hall manager of a roommate choice will receive a letter informing them they are in the consolidation process.  This letter will have a list of individuals who have also lost their roommates.  An Occupancy Status Change form will be attached.

This process takes place even when there are no individuals waiting for a single room within a hall.  Philosophically, it is only fair that if there are individuals within a hall paying for a single room, then others should not live in a single room for double room rate.

Any individual refusing the hall manager's assignment will be billed for a single room according to the week their roommate initially moved out or the week the halls opened (if roommate was a no-show).

If all extended housing is empty, may keep the room as a single and pay the adjusted rate.  The individual will be billed for the single room from the week his/her roommate checked out or the week the halls opened (if roommate was a no-show).

Find another roommate or move to another room within a seven-day period.  If after seven days the individual has not found a roommate or moved to another room, that individual will be billed for a single room until he/she finds one according to the week their roommate initially moved out.

If a student's roommate moves out of the room after the eighth week of the Spring Semester and another roommate cannot be assigned to the room, the student will have the option of remaining in the room and will not be charged the single room rate.  This provision is made as long as the roommate moved out of the room through no fault or cause of the student remaining in the room.  Whatever option the individual wishes to take, he/she must inform the hall manager two (2) days after his/her roommate vacates the room.

If you are leaving the residence halls, your room must be back to its original condition, clean, and ready for another person to move in. You must check out with a resident assistant and follow check-out procedures (including the return of your key) to avoid additional charges.

If you reside in a residence hall fall term and are returning to the residence halls for spring term, winter break housing is included in the cost of your room.  If you will be staying in your room during winter break and you want card access to your hall, you will need to complete a Break Housing form.  If you are not registered with the Residence Life office, you will not have card access to your hall.

We provide minimal services in the residence halls including mail, desk service, and resident assistant emergency contacts throughout all ten residence halls. Students new to the residence halls spring term will check in during the established spring opening date.

If you are not returning to the residence halls spring term, you must be checked out of your room by the end of fall term.  Students not returning to the residence halls spring term but requesting J-Term housing, need to complete the Break Housing form.  These students will be housed in temporary housing and will be billed a weekly housing charge.

Summer housing is billed at a weekly rate; Summer 2007 rates are $112/week for a single room and $85/week per person in a double room. Work through the Residence Life Office in paying for your summer housing.If you are a UWRF student taking summer classes, summer housing is available only during the summer session that you are taking classes. Summer housing is not available (unless you are working full-time for a University Department) if you are not taking summer classes.

Joining a professional organization related to your field of study can open opportunities for networking with individuals in your career field. Often, some of the best job positions are discovered through networking. Also, being a participating member of a professional organization demonstrates to employers your initiative in maintaining professional knowledge in your field.

Research an organization before joining to ensure that the organization is an active and growing one. Typically, a fee is required to join a professional organization to cover the cost of annual/semi-annual meeting and speaker costs.

An informational interview is an interview that you initiate - you ask the questions. The purpose is to obtain information, not to get a job. You may be researching a career, researching a company or attempting to network with someone in a particular field.

Contrary to what you may think, top level managers are not necessarily the best sources of information to contact early in your process. Individuals who hold positions similar to the one’s you plan to seek are your best contacts early in the process.

Begin by assessing your own personal network of family, friends, and co-workers. Ask each person you know for possible contacts in your field(s) of choice. A personal referral is the ideal referral, but cold calls to individuals you may have read or heard about can also be effective.

Again, do your research. Read information on the occupation and/or company so that you can ask meaningful questions. You will want to develop a list of questions prior to the interview; remain flexible, though, and respond to the information presented, which may be even more valuable! Remember to consider your own values and preferences in preparing these questions. Your objective is to see if this occupation would be the type of career that you would enjoy or if the organization would provide what you are looking for in a company or job.

UW-River Falls' English program teaches students to be insightful readers, thinkers, and writers. Students become adept in word-processing, publishing technology, and research methodology. They become life-long learners with an awareness of historical, cultural, and philosophical issues. An education in literature, composition, criticism, and language teaches students to write effectively, to think critically, to read widely, to weigh values, and to communicate ideas.

The English Department faculty are dedicated, enthusiastic teachers. They are readily available to meet with students. Our faculty members are committed to helping each student achieve his or her educational, personal, and professional goals. Students appreciate the energy and effort of their instructors.

The B.A. in English, Literature Emphasis-Liberal Arts prepares students to be broadly educated, culturally and historically, and skilled in thinking critically, researching, and writing. The degree prepares students for jobs in business, government and nonprofit organizations, journalism, and publishing.

The B.A. in English, Creative Writing Emphasis-Liberal Arts gives students preparation in both creative writing and literature. This degree helps students interested in pursuing a graduate degree or a career in the publishing and writing fields.

The B.S. in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages-Education prepares students to teach children who are non-native speakers of English in the public schools. Depending on the educational setting in which the student intends to work, such a major can work well with any of the minors that are certifiable areas of study.

The Bachelor of Science English - Education degree is primarily intended to certify students to teach English in public high schools though the core skills it develops have broad application as well. The B.S. in English-Education prepares students to teach literature, interpretive skills, writing, language, research, and critical thinking skills in high schools. Students must choose a minor. Minors in which students can obtain a second certification to teach in that subject are popular choices. Some of these minors include speech communication and theatre arts, a modern language, journalism, and history.

The Bachelor of Science in Broad Area English-Education degree is designed to provide prospective high school teachers with additional areas of study that support their core English courses and that respond to the current demands of the teaching situations in modern secondary schools. No minor is required with this major; the Broad Area in effect replaces the minor.

The Professional Writing Minor Business-Government option provides study and practice in the spectrum of communication from graphic design to computer literacy and emphasizes training useful in business, industry, and government. The minor is not recommended for English Education majors. Students selecting this minor are advised to complete an English internship, ENGL 379.

The Professional Writing Minor-Creative Writing option serves as a foundation for general publication or in-house publication in large businesses and also for "professional writing" in its traditional sense: "free-lance" writing as a primary or supplemental source of income or as an avocation. The minor is not recommended for English Education majors. Students selecting this minor are advised to complete an English internship, ENGL 379.

The TESOL Majors and Minors  are English Department programs designed for both native and nonnative speakers of English. Graduates are prepared for employment in teaching English to speakers of other languages in the United States and in other countries. Students will take courses in language acquisition, theory and practice of teaching English as a second or foreign language, pedagogical grammar, linguistics, and cultural studies. Some of these programs enable students to acquire certification in teaching English as a second language in grade K-12.

Conservation is the planned management of our natural resources: water, soil, air, wildlife, forests, and more. Planned management has evolved from the standpoint that people and the environment have requirements for their continued existence. Without the knowledgeable utilization of these natural resources, the quality of human life and the quality of our environment will suffer. With a growing human population and its associated demands for and impact on our natural resources, the field of conservation is directed at understanding our environment, and applying and advancing management techniques so as to maintain sustainable communities for all life on Earth.

Conservation is concerned with the management of the Earth's natural resources for sustained utilization. Since these resources are varied and complex, a person interested in the field of conservation has many opportunities for developing their professional career. A person could take a broad academic approach and pursue a career in the more holistic types of occupations such as a county conservationist, an interpretive naturalist for a private or public nature center, or enforcing environmental regulations as a conservation warden.

Another approach would be to specialize in some specific area of conservation and make a career out of advancing a particular piece of the environmental puzzle. This more specialized approach would enable a person to develop a career in soil conservation, water management or hydrology, wildlife management, forestry, air quality, solid waste management, and the like.

The Conservation major is a broad spectrum curriculum designed to provide the student with an extensive physical, biological and social science knowledge base. The major is a professional career path emphasizing interdisciplinary skills necessary to function in field-oriented natural resource positions. Flexibility built into this curriculum through the use of numerous minors and elective courses allows the student to specifically focus this major to best meet their career objectives for working with our natural resources.

Environmental science is the study of the natural environment, integrating the sciences with knowledge of our impacts on the planet and a desire to solve environmental problems. The Environmental Science major is an interdisciplinary major designed to prepare students to face increasingly complex environmental challenges in the context of environmental quality management and sustainable development.

Environmental Science majors are prepared to monitor, model and manage environmental systems in the areas of environmental quality and risk evaluation, sampling and analysis, remediation, research and regulatory compliance.

Graduates pursue careers in environmental consulting, regulatory agencies or corporations. They may choose field-oriented positions in pollution monitoring and remediation including air, water or soil quality assessment and remediation. Environmental Scientists also control and minimize the impacts of technology and waste on the environment. Graduates may choose specialized positions in environmental policy, environmental risk assessment, ecological assessment or computer modeling. Corporations and government agencies require environmental science graduates to ensure compliance with applicable law and regulations intended to preserve the environment. Students with environmental research interests are also prepared to pursue advanced degrees.

Land use planning is a cyclical process of determining a community's needs and then setting utilization and development goals to meet those needs in an efficient, effective, and sustainable manner. Although a highly technical discipline, land use planning also relies on ethical considerations and an understanding of social dynamics as equitable solutions are sought in providing development options to benefit the common good through democratic processes.

The focus of the Land Use Planning major is the study of the interaction between people and the land, especially in a rural/ urban context. More specifically, it is professional training that seeks to balance the legitimate land use rights of property owners with the needs of society and the sustainability of natural systems.

Natural resource, economic, legal, and cultural opportunities and constraints are identified, along with specific methods used to determine the best use for an area - such as agriculture, recreation, transportation, residential, business, industrial or wildlife habitat.

According to the Department of Labor's 1992 SCAN report: "Increasingly, workers have to work in teams--within the same function, across functions, across hierarchical levels, and within supplier-producer-customer networks--and in a multicultural environment. These features of the work environment generate the need for skills in both interpersonal communication and conflict resolution."

Choosing a major or a minor is one step in a process that can lead to a number of different career options. Given this, the knowledge you acquire in the Ethnic Studies minor is useful in a number of different pursuits.

Ethnic Studies minor is designed to allow students to study and focus their attention on the ethnic experiences in America. In addition, the minor provides courses that allow students to examine ethnicity in a broader international context. The courses included in the minor have been selected to allow for individual flexibility. It is possible for Arts and Sciences majors to double minor in Ethnic and Women's Studies with minimal additional credits. The double minor is flexible enough for students to graduate on time while supporting virtually any major. By choosing the Women's Studies/Ethnic Studies double minor, students also fulfill six hours of the Arts and Sciences Liberal Arts requirements as well as the three-hour cultural diversity requirement.

"Sky Garden (Zen Garden in the Sky)" is a stainless steel cable and dichronic glass mobile by Philadelphia artist Ray King that adorns the north entrance to the library's atrium. This is a commissioned piece purchased in 1997 to provide the finishing touch for the newly remodeled Chalmer Davee Library.

Exhibit areas must be booked in advance. Exhibit areas include the Harriet Barry Gallery, two recessed wall cases, two glass table cases, and two oak cases. Installation art exhibits may be placed in open areas of the library if the space is approved by the Exhibits Committee.

Chalmer Davee recalled the day he first arrived on the River Falls campus. His father had been appointed Superintendent of the Training School Department in the fall of 1917 but the rest of the family was unable to relocate immediately.

Three Lakes and Neillsville, but his goal of becoming a doctor remained. He spent two years on the Madison campus and then enrolled in the Medical School at the University of Minnesota where he earned his M.D. degree in 1929. He first practiced in Montana but returned to River Falls in 1930. Along with his private practice, he became team physician at the College and had close and lasting contacts with the school from that time until his retirement. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.

"teachers" be dropped and that the colleges be authorized to offer the liberal arts degree. He worked hard in pursuit of that goal and was successful in 1951. He was also instrumental in seeing that the River Falls campus got a share of the substantial building program. A new Industrial Arts building was added along with the first two major buildings in 25 years -- Hathorn Hall and the library.

When the Board of Regents unanimously accepted a resolution that the new library be named "The Chalmer Davee Library," President Kleinpell wrote to Dr. Davee, "I hope it recognizes in some small way what you have done for the college at River Falls. It is my firm conviction, and one shared by the faculty, that you have contributed much to the stature of higher education in Wisconsin in general and to this college in particular." When he left the Board of Regents, plans already were on the drawing board for a new health and physical education building.

The 1953 yearbook was dedicated to the Regent and the editor wrote, "We hope that by dedicating the 1953 Meletean to Dr. Davee we may express in another small way our appreciation for what Dr. Davee has done for River Falls and for us, the student body."

He had lived to watch the seeds he had planted grow and flourish. The institution had become the University of Wisconsin - River Falls. It offered not only the liberal arts courses, for which he had fought, but advanced degrees. The health and physical education building, in the planning stages when he left the Board of Regents, was completed and now complemented by the Hunt Arena. A student center and Rodli Commons stood on campus. In addition to Hathorn Hall, there were another eight residence halls for both men and women.

Harriet Barry, associate professor of Library Science, was on the Davee Library staff for seventeen years, serving as cataloging librarian supervising the reclassification of library collections from the Dewey Decimal System to the Library of Congress Reclassification System.

Larry is an Extension Animal Health Specialist with particular interest in dairy cattle. His focus is on preventing disease and managing conditions that influence the productivity and profitability of dairy  herds.

Larry serves as Secretary-Treasurer of the Northwstern Wisconsin Veterinary Medical Association (NWVMA), providing continuing education opportunities to members. Recent continuing education sessions have focused on ophthalmology, Clostridial diseases, West Nile Virus, dermatology and biosecurity.

Dairy Specialist working primarily in the area of human resource management on dairy farms. He has made many presentations and written several articles on recruitment, selection, performance evaluation, job quality, and other areas of HRM. He has been a national leader in recognizing and communicating the importance of farm image as a factor in recruitment. As a ruminant nutritionist, he has developed a strong interest in management intensive rotational grazing for dairy cattle.

Had a short essay on the importance of farm image and job quality in recruiting included in the new book, Ag Help Wanted - Guidelines for Managing Agricultural Labor. The essay was originally written by Dennis for a list-serve.

Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota M.S. from the University of Minnesota B.S. from the University of Minnesota All degrees are in Animal Science with emphasis in ruminant nutrition, physiology and agricultural economics.

Forage Specialist. His areas of expertise include: forage establishment methods, stand evaluation techniques, no-till and reduced tillage forage production, pasture improvement methods, grazing management and species selection.

Authored Forage Establishment, a chapter in Forages: the Science of Grassland Agriculture, with Michael Collins of the University of Kentucky. This is the standard textbook used in forage courses by colleges across the country.

Dennis manages the Team Forage website which serves as a major source of rotational grazing information for producers in Wisconsin, and an important communication vehicle for the 30 different grazing networks in the state. Producers have found it to be one of the most complete sites on rotational grazing in the country.

Commercial Fruit Specialist who helps growers make improvements in cultural efficiency to remain competitive, improve their profitability, diversify their operations, and respond to changing government regulation of pesticide usage. He also maintains an active research program focused on developing winter hardy fruits - strawberries, raspberries, and plums - of high quality, good yield and superior pest and disease resistance for Midwest commercial growers.

Efforts to develop appropriate propagation techniques for new plum cultivars continue. This is one of the last steps before final testing can begin and new plum cultivars are released. This project is in cooperation with Brent McCown at UW-Madison and is funded by a University of Wisconsin Consortium for Agriculture and Natural Resources (CERANR) grant.

Work continues with raspberries. Funding from a UW-System Applied Research Grant program is allowing Brian to identify and evaluate new summer-bearing raspberries. A second year of funding from the Wisconsin Agriculture Development and Diversification program is supporting ongoing efforts in raspberry breeding for Wisconsin's commercial fruit growers. The National Association of Bramble Growers (NABGA) has also provided financial support for this work.

Each year Brian plans, hosts and/or presents at various events for samll fruit and vegetable growers, including the annual Wisconsin Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Conference, annual Field Days for the various grower associations, as well as Master Gardener training sessions.

Farm Finanical Management Specialist with extensive industry experience in dairy farm and agribusiness management. He works with Cooperative Extension and the Center for Dairy Profitability to serve and support programming efforts in managerial finance, operations management, decision-making, human resource management and strategic management for farms and agribusinesses. Gregg has expertise on the managment and economic implications of dairy farm expansion and culling.

He also directs the Survey Research Center (SRC) at UW-River Falls and in this role he oversees various survey projects to assist communities with determining needs assessments, gathering residents' opinions on various issues, quantifying the impact of tourism, etc. You can check out some of the most recent surveys the SRC has conducted on the News link on the Survey Research Center website.

David is currently working with Kim Zeuli (UW-Madison) to investigate innovations in agricultural cooperatives in Wisconsin. They will be quantifying the level and variation of innovative activities as well as looking into the sources of innovation to determine why some are more innovative than others, assessing the impact of new cooperative structures, and measuring the implications of innovative activity in terms of cooperative performance and member welfare. This study is being funded by the Universtiy of Wisconsin Consortium for Extension and Research in Agriculture and Natural Resources (CERANR).

Greg Lawless (UW-Madison) is collaborating with David on a second project funded by CERANR. Producers are increasingly looking to limit their risk in this volatile economy and are exploring and investing in the "value-added" arena. This project is studying Wisconsin's producers' investment attitudes, opinions and activities related to off-farm, ag-related ventures. The goal is to better udnestand the extent to which Wisconsin's agricultural producers already invest or are looking to invest in off-farm, ag-related ventures, and their reasons for investing or not.

The Wisconsin Idea - a working paper drafted by David discussing the condition of the Wisconsin Idea today and the challenges that must be addressed if it is to remain a defining characteristic of the state's culture.

Food Safety and Microbiology Specialist with expertise in the microbiological quality of milk and dairy products. He consults with food industry clients and county-based Extension staff on food safety issues.

Use Specialist working with county-based Extension personnel and local government units to provide educational programs and materials on comprehensive planning. She was recently recognized as a certified planner by the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP). Alicia has previous planning experience with county, regional and federal agencies.

Alicia teamed up with Basin Educator Darren Lockner and her CNRED colleagues in Dunn, St. Croix, and Pierce counties to provide educational programming on a regional basis. Together they initiated a series of tri-county workshops focusing on the nine elements of a comprehensive plan. Four workshops have been held, three more are planned for 2003 to cover the remaining elements. Attendance ranged from 60-100 and evaluations were very favorable. As a result of their participation, local officials have formed planning committees, developed and implemented surveys, submitted grant applications and made progress in developing their comprehensive plans.

Participate with the Chancellor in the establishment and termination of the functions and memberships of all standing committees. There shall be provision for the establishment of faculty committees within the By-laws of the Constitution. Specific provisions governing the powers, responsibilities, and procedures of faculty committees and the procedure of their appointment are to be found in the By-laws of the Constitution.

Serve as coordinating and expediting agency for the work of standing committees and assign responsibility along with the Chancellor for the execution of studies and activities of these committees. All recommendations for policy changes in the orientation and direction of all committees must be submitted for approval to both the Faculty Senate and the Chancellor.

According to the Constitution, elections are held during spring semester for divisional slots first, and then for at-large seats. We have five divisions: the CAFES, the CAS, and the CEPS (the first three colleges), the Fourth Division, and the CBE (the newest "division"). All tenure-track faculty and academic staff have "faculty status." Thus, the "faculty" of a college includes tenure-track faculty and academic staff within the college. The Fourth Division acquired its current name when there were only three colleges, and currently consists of academic staff outside the four colleges (i.e. student personnel, university services, and library academic staff), all of whom also have faculty status.

Faculty should make nominations of potential candidates within their division: one slot in the CAFES, two slots in the CAS, and two slots in the Fourth Division (there are no openings for either the CEPS or the CBE this year). For each open slot, the top two nominees are placed onto the ballot. Faculty in the CAFES can nominate one person, faculty in either the CAS or the Fourth Division can nominate two people. Please note that this becomes, in essence, a primary election and the greater the number of nominations, the greater the chances of finishing in the top two. Ties are to be broken by lot.

According to the Constitution, the Senate must announce the list of nominees to the campus community and allow three business days for faculty to submit petitions to be added to the final ballot (i.e. signatures of a least five eligible voters within the division). This completes the final slate of candidates and a secret ballot is used to select the winners. Any ties are to be broken by lot.

Preliminary divisional slates and notification of right to petition are  announced in Governance Update (any faculty member, according to the Constitution, can petition with five signatures to be added to the ballot. These must be given to Ogden Rogers by Feb 21).

The Faculty Senate is the legislative arm of the faculty. As such, the faculty delegates to the Senate its powers and responsibilities as affect the academic policies and programs, faculty affairs, and the general welfare of the University in accordance with the provisions of Article III.

To join the Falcon Action Network, please fill out the form below. FAN will periodically send you information via email about Wisconsin legislative activities so that you can stay informed on the latest issues.

There many ways you can become involved as an advocate for UWRF through the Falcon Action Network. These could include writing, calling or emailing you local representative to express your opinion; writing a letter to the editor of your local newspaper; or urging the editor of your local newspaper, television station or radio station to take an editorial position in favor of UWRF's legislative positions.

I know you’ll be facing tough decisions in the weeks and months ahead as you work on the budget. And, as do all Wisconsin residents, I want to see my taxes stay as low as possible. But I also want to see UWRF continue to attract and retain the best faculty members, rather than cut staff. UWRF faculty and staff are working closely with business and industry, as well as local government leaders, to address the opportunities for economic development, and the issues of growth and change in the St. Croix Valley. UWRF is a real asset to the region and Wisconsin, and I hope you will support its initiatives.

I realize that the state of Wisconsin faces difficult budget decisions, but I truly believe that it is time to reinvest in UW-River Falls and that University of Wisconsin System. This will be in the best long-term interest of our state.

Another effective way of getting your message across is to personally visit your state representatives. Most members of the state Legislature return home on the weekends. Take time to call or visit them and talk about the session events. If they have introduced legislation, show an interest in their efforts.

In January 2007, Wisconsin will begin a two-year legislative session to address Wisconsin policy. During the course of that cycle, there will be dozens of pieces of legislation that will affect UWRF. These range from the critical state budget to a host of bills that could affect access, student health, faculty members' ability to teach, and employment issues.

The 2007-09 biennial budget request by the Board of Regents addresses access, affordability, and growth. The proposa asks funding for UWRF to increase its freshmen retention rate; diversity recruitment in teacher education; to improve the technology that allows students to more easily track their transfers of credits from other institutions; and planning funding for our proposed Health & Human Performance Building.

Each Friday during the legislative session, the UW System prepares an analysis of proposed legislation affecting the UW System. The digest also tracks what legislation passed, and will keep you informed on what the legislature will be discussing in upcoming weeks. As a FAN member, you will receive this electronically each week. You can visit the archives of past editions here.

UW System Bill Positions.A continuoulsy updated list of the dozens of pieces of legislation introduced each year affecting UWRF and the UW System. It includes links to the text of the bill, current status, and the Board of Regents positive, if available.

This free digest carries all Wisconsin newspaper media coverage and editorials on state public policy issues. It also features news releases by the executive branch, legislators and special interest groups.

"With your eyes fixed on the far horizon, however and wherever your destiny, you are the caretakers and shapers of our humanity, our land, and our ideals," said Splett, an agricultural economic professor. "I have two hopes for you--that you will always be passionate in your work, and that you will always be humble."

In his keynote, Splett shared anecdotes about alumni and students who are meeting a greater purpose. "Astronaut [and UWRF alumnus] Dan Brandenstein ... reached into space on four shuttle missions... challenging us to innovative and imaginative ideas. He was and is a shaper of our ideals."

A UWRF graduate himself, Splett lauded the careers of fellow alumnus Wong How Man, an explorer, conservationist and founder of the Chinese Exploration Research Society, who discovered a new source of the Yangtze River, and who received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University. In 2002, Wong "stood here to be honored as a caretaker of our humanity and land." He also mentioned classmate Sig Hanson, director of World-Vision Pakistan, who continues to provide earthquake relief and other humanitarian service to that part of the world. Splett also cited the volunteer efforts of students with Hurricane Katrina efforts and other activities.

As a teacher, Splett said, the purpose is "always for the students, always we teach to the best of our ability and always so that you graduate to fulfill your greater purpose as caretakers and shapers." He noted that his wife, Becky, is retiring from teaching third grade this year, and that he takes comfort in the fact that many of their former students have become teachers and will carry on the joy of teaching and learning.

Splett has served as interim dean and assistant dean of the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences as well as chair of the agricultural economics department. Splett holds a Ph.D. in agricultural economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He received the UWRF Advisor of the Year Award in 2005. Prior to coming to UWRF, he was a vocational-agriculture instructor in the Barron and Turtle Lake high schools, worked in private industry and taught economics at UW-Stout.

In welcoming the graduates, Chancellor Don Betz urged them to use their three powers of encouragement, service and gratitude whenever possible. Betz also announced the Kansas City Chiefs Football Club as the recipient of the 2006 Distinguished Service Award, given to an individual or organization that has made exemplary contributions to UWRF. The award will be accepted by a member of the KCC organization at spring commencement because of the recent death of KCC founder Lamar Hunt.

The event was held to raise funds for the children's charity, When You WIish Upon a Star, for children with serious or life-threatening conditions. Each UW student participated approximately $20 to the Scottish charity.

The basic scientific disciplines offered in a bachelor's program in food science generally include: food chemistry, food microbiology, food processing, food rheology, food engineering and quality control in the food industry. (See also, Food Science Courses offered at UWRF). Food science students usually have training in basic sciences such as physics, mathematics, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, etc.

Once a student chooses to major in Food Science at UW-River Falls, the faculty advisors in the program will work with the student to determine their career interests in the broad field of Food Science.

America evolved largely from the dairy science programs that were common, particularly at agricultural colleges, during the early to mid portion of the 20th century. The discipline emerged to include not only dairy science but also meat science, cereal science, seafood science, the study of fruit and vegetable products and the like.

The food industry is one of the largest manufacturing industry in the world and is growing steadily as the consumer demands for convenient, safe and nutritious food/beverages grows. More emphasis is presently being placed on the safety of the food supply.

Emphasis is also being given to new energy-and cost efficient technologies in the processing of foods including microwave pasteurization, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, heat pump drying, etc. and therefore the requirements for highly trained food scientists with technological expertise are increasing. (See a sample of careers for food scientists).

English, History, Journalism, and Speech/Theatre. Film Studies examines film as an art form, as an industry and as the most popular and most influential communication medium of the twentieth century. Film Studies provides an interdisciplinary approach to visual literacy as it introduces students to film history, theory, criticism, and production.

For history students, films on historical topics offer visual understandings of past events and eras. Film study also provides a means to explore how filmed interpretations are reflections of the times in which the films were made and the filmmakers who created them, and also the degree to which influential films create public memories. Students can learn to recognize revisionist history and to compare the conventions and aims of the historical documentary and the feature film.

For students of literature and drama, film adaptations of short stories, novels, and plays provide opportunity for comparative analysis of written and visual texts and the means to understand how the narrative conventions of both mediums create meaning. Recurring themes in film remakes offer students a way to explore how literary themes are imitated, updated, or challenged. With film fast becoming the literature of our age, film studies offers students a step into the future of literary studies.

For students interested in writing film criticism and film reviews, film study places films in the context of film history and provides the opportunity to examine films in terms of types, genres, and techniques. Students can study theories of representation and explore how camera placement, lighting, editing, sound, and music create meaning and invite specific viewer response.

For students interested in cultural change, films offer periodic snapshots of changing ideas about such topics as gender roles, the family, the law, violence, war, sexual relations, and romantic love. Films are a source for exploring conflict between cultures, and students can trace changes in how women and ethnic minorities have been represented and are choosing to re-present themselves.

For students interested in filmmaking, film study provides the opportunity to write screenplays and to create and edit films and videos. Students can learn the history and conventions of documentary, narrative, and experimental films and can explore the varying styles of individual American and international writers, directors, cinematographers, and editors.

For students preparing to teach, film study provides the opportunity to examine age and subject appropriate films and to explore various teaching methods. Students can also apply commonly practiced film methodologies to create goal-oriented lesson plans for classroom use.

Comedians: "The StageBenders." Compared to a contemporary Abbott and Costello, Kim Thomassen and Gust Alexander were two junior high school buddies from Minneapolis who liked to make each other laugh. Today, under the playful moniker "The Stagebenders," Thomassen and Alexander are America's top comedy duo, playing to sell-out crowds and rave reviews.

If you haven't already done so, please be sure to activate your Falcon Account before arriving on campus. You will need your Falcon Account to access class registration, financial aid information, housing information, university email, and your student record. You need to activate your account before you can register for classes.

All new students are required to take the Wisconsin Regional Placement Tests before registering for classes. These tests are offered regionally throughout the spring and each evening prior to new student registration. If you have already taken the tests, we will have your scores ready for you and your advisor to review on your registration day.

If you have NOT taken these tests, need to take them before you register for classes. You should plan to arrive on campus by 3:45 p.m. the day before your assigned registration date. Testing is available in the River Room of Rodli Commons the evening before each registration date.

If you have previous experience in a foreign language and would like to continue studying that language at UWRF, you will need to take a modern language placement test. Modern language placement testing will be given the morning of each registration program in Rodli Commons.

You're so important in this process that we have a program designed just for you! Our staff will help you understand University policies and transition issues that your student may experience. We'll offer suggestions about how to be a partner in their college experience and provide answers to all your questions.

The outstanding faculty and staff at UWRF are committed to providing you with the best possible resources to make your undergraduate experience both rewarding and enriching. However, your experience and success will ultimately depend on you, and on the extent to which you actively engage in the UWRF community and all of the opportunities it offers.

Both in class and out of class, it is necessary for you to invest in yourself and those around you. Through exciting coursework and the rich menu of extracurricular activities, you are encouraged to commit to expanding your knowledge and abilities and challenge yourself to engage in the new, unfamiliar, and unknown.

The First-Year Experience program at UW-River Falls assists new students as they transition to and through college. FYE is a comprehensive program of academic and co-curricular activities that enhance student success.

Academic Day; Family Day; new student and family communications; oversight of National Honorary and emerging leaders programs; and developing partnerships with faculty/staff that connect students with academic and co-curricular activities.

Presentations will also be given by representatives of various companies involved in developing and marketing rapid and automated methods for microbiological analysis of food, water and the enviroment.

Limited enrollment, registrations are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration fees are fully refundable if cancellation is made prior to September 30, 2006. A refund is subject to a $50 cancellation fee after September 30. Substitutions from the same company will be accepted. Notification of changes would be appreciated.

Limited parking will be available on campus during the conference. UW-River Falls will provide shuttle service from the River Falls motels to/from campus each morning and afternoon of the conference and for evening events.

The Sponsorship Program gives companies an opportunity to participate directly in the 26th Annual UW-River Falls Food Microbiology Symposium and Rapid and Automated Methods Workshop. The Sponsorship Program is designed to provide a continuing education opportunity for food industry professionals, government regulators and others interested in food and water microbiology and methods for detection, quantification, and characterization of pathogens, spoilage organisms, and toxins.

The Sponsorship Program provides an excellent opportunity for companies to showcase the latest technology in the detection, isolation and characterization of foodborne microorganisms and their toxins. Attendance at last year's symposium was the highest ever and included a diverse group of professionals from the food processing industry, regulatory agencies, and academia, including several international participants. We hope to attract even more attendees this year. The program is designed to provide an opportunity for company representatives to interact with the participants in a workshop atmosphere.

In the past, contributions from companies helped defray the expenses for speakers, visiting fellows, and hospitality, etc. I would like to invite organizations to support this proven Sponsorship Program by participating as a Contributing Sponsor (minimum contribution $500). Each Contributing Sponsor will be recognized at the conference and invited to participate in the program. Contributing Sponsors may choose to make a 15 minute presentation on their instrumentation or services, demonstrate a test or instrument at the workshop, and/or prepare a technical poster on an application involving the company's products. Company literature will also be included in our conference manual. Presentation and workshop times are limited so we recommend reserving a slot as early as possible.

The poster should have the same components as a technical/scientific paper: an Abstract (as previously submitted), Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, and finally a Conclusion. Each of these sections in your poster should be titled accordingly so viewers can easily find them.

There is no scheduled poster session. Posters will be on display at the conference site (the Blue Room in Rodli Commons) for the duration of the program. Attendees will be able to view them before the morning sessions, during breaks, and over the lunch hour.

If you choose to fax your abstract please put the original in the mail to us as soon as possible. If you choose to send your abstract, please include your name, phone number and/or e-mail address in case we have to contact you.

If you have questions that were not answered by the respective page(s) from this site use the general contact information provided below. This page also provides specific contact information, however, anything that is covered below will be covered by the general contact information as well. Your question will be properly directed to the appropriate department to provide you with the most efficient answer.

UW-River Falls has teamed up with computer vendors to provide you with educational discounts on computer systems.Financing options are available on each vendor's website.A knowledgeable FredNet Services technician would be happy to set up an appointment with you to translate the computer terms into terms that are much easier to understand. This will help you make an informed decision when purchasing a new computer system. FredNet technicians are not working for the computer vendor; instead the technicians are looking out for your best interest. Put a technician to work for you!All of the computers offered by these vendors meet our minimum requirements but you should have a look at our computer recommendations in the support section of our website before you order.

WISC is an online catalog that allows University of Wisconsin students to purchase popular software packages at substantial discounts. Just go to www.wisc.edu/wisc choose River Falls from the list of UW System schools and order up your software. Software is shipped UPS and usually arrives within 2 - 3 business daysIncoming students: You will be eligible to make software purchases starting the first week of the semester.

FredNet does have some minimum computer specifications. If you bring a computer to campus that is below these standards, it may still function on our network. However, computers which do not meet these specifications will not be considered a priority for support, but we will try to assist you when we have time.We provide support for both Windows and Mac OS computers. We do not support open-source operating systems such as Linux and FreeBSD, as these are non-commercial operating systems without official developer support.

Another emerging technology that is starting to be readily available in consumer machines is the dual-core processor. Without getting too technical, dual-core processors split the load across two CPUs (or "cores") on one chip. These can lead to a great boost in productivity and is something that is being featured on a lot of new machines, including Apple's full line of computers.

The numbers next to a processor (for example, 2.0 Ghz), really have very little to do with the actual performance of the chip, unless you are comparing within the same line of products. Basically higher numbers mean the chip can handle more information faster. However since different chips handle the information differently, the real-life performance you see can vary. The one thing to keep in mind is that all the chips you look at will be sufficient for the purposes mentioned in our introduction. The best advice is to simply find something in your price range and don't get overly-concerned with having the "best" chip on the market (the prices would be astronomical if you did).

Just like CPUs, there a number of different choices for RAM. However, since we are looking at a consumer, store-bought computer, we don't need to get into detail on those. Most manufactures offer the same generic RAM in their machines (you may see terms such as SD and DDR appended to the word, these have to do with the way the RAM works but you should not be overly concerned with them).512 MB of RAM is considered adequate for the average user. However, as programs become more demanding and with a new Windows operating system just around the corner (Windows Vista) we recommend going with at least 1 GB (1024 MB) of RAM in order to allow headroom for new technologies. One nice thing about RAM is that it is pretty easily upgradeable, so you aren't necessarily locked into your decision here.

Those willing to spend a little extra may want to consider getting second ordinary CD/DVD-ROM drive. This can be nice for copying direct from one CD/DVD to another, or for browsing a data disc while burning another, etc. A second drive is a pretty inexpensive upgrade, and also common on a lot of desktop systems. Many of the computers you look at may already have a second drive.

In the case that a student may call upon the services of FredNet Services, the student will hereby agree to the following terms:That I have read and understand my warranty in relation to the equipment affected by the problem. I do understand the effects that the service performed by the FredNet Services staff to rectify my problem or concern will have on my warranty.That I understand that in the process of correcting problems with my computer related hardware that there is a potential for data loss at any time.

But, I understand that I hold the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and its staff harmless of liability of any damages to computer hardware and/or personal property that may occur while working in my residence hall room. Often working on computers and televisions require getting around the equipment, I have made attempts at clearing these areas to prevent damage to personal property.That I understand that the FredNet Services staff must report any illegal software (i.e.warez) or other illegal data stores (i.e., child pornography) that may be encountered while working on the problem to the proper authorities. I further understand that what may appear as a simple problem may require in depth probing and investigation of the computer and this process may reveal data that I have "hidden" in the computer. Similarly, other illegal actions related to and not related to technology must be reported by FredNet Services staff to the proper authorities.That if the problem is in some manner related to my roommate's equipment, I have their agreement (whether written or verbal) for FredNet Services staff to work on their equipment and have agreed to the above terms also. FredNet Services staff cannot make the determination of what is my equipment and my roommate's.FredNet Services reserves the right to refuse to provide services at any time.

Access to the Internet is a precious commodity to students. There is often a great desire to have wide-open access and be free from wires when using the Internet. Many campuses have decided to implement wireless services without regard for the security concerns that are present. It is our campus policy that wireless access not be allowed for use at this time because of some grave concerns regarding the security of such technology. There are ways that wireless can be secure, but the solutions often are costly in equipment, software and labor to implement.Due to the immense concerns over security the following actions are being enforced by University Administration:No wireless data devices will be allowed at anytime by any student living or visiting the Residence Halls. This includes 802.11b (WIFI), 802.11a and 802.11g or any variant that comes from these standards. Due to concerns in enforcing airspace security, we will not grant exemptions for systems that are not connected to the wired data network.Wireless Bluetooth technology that is not used in conjunction with data networking (such as cellular telephones) will be permissible. Bluetooth may not be used to connect a computer to other devices as this provides a direct path through that computer to the campus network. Bluetooth is commonly found in cellular telephones and other devices not associated with transmitting Internet data. The use of Bluetooth may not be used when connected to the campus network through a computer or PDA.The use of wireless keyboards is discouraged, since you can "sniff" the radio signals as you type your password, credit cards numbers etc.Services that are available in the public domain, such as XYZ Cellular, are not of concern to the University airspace management. These devices are already coordinated through the FCC and do not pose additional security threat to our environment any more than other Internet sites do. Subscribing to one of these public services not only gives you Internet access on campus but in other areas too.FredNet Services will actively monitor campus airspace for 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g carriers (and other new standards that are released). Any presence of these carriers will be investigated and the appropriate students dealt with according to our already established Acceptable Use Policy.

FredNet wishes to provide a safe virtual environment for the users of the network. We can only make it safe by establishing some rules of the road that we all abide by to make it safer. If everyone abides by the rules, we should have no incidents where people are hurt either emotionally or physically.

Minor infractions of this policy, when accidental, such as consuming excessive resources or overloading computer systems, are generally resolved informally by FredNet administration. This may be done through voice or e-mail, or in-person discussion and education.Repeated minor infractions or misconduct which is more serious may result in the temporary or permanent loss of FredNet access privileges, or the modification of those privileges. More serious violations include, but are not limited to unauthorized use of computer resources, attempts to steal passwords or data, unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted materials, repeated harassment or threatening behavior. In addition, offenders may be referred to their sponsoring advisor, department, or other appropriate University office for further action. If the user is a student, the matter may be referred to the Dean of Students Office for disciplinary action.Any action that violates local, state, or federal laws may result in the immediate loss of FredNet computing privileges and will be referred to the appropriate University offices and/or law enforcement authorities.In the case of disconnection because of suspected use violations, the user can expect that the FredNet administration will make every effort for a speedy resolution and resumption of service if appropriate. Further, the user whose FredNet access is disconnected permanently because of suspected use violations can expect to use the service the following academic year, unless otherwise specified by the sanction placed against them by the University.Due to the ongoing changes in the technology industry, these FredNet Security Policies and Acceptable Use Guidelines may have to change during the school year. On any given day, the updated guidelines may be found at www.frednet.uwrf.edu . As part of this contract, you will be held responsible for adhering to the guidelines that are found on this site, as they may change without prior notice.

MEXICO IS... truly a cultural experience. A country of enormous geographic and ethnic diversity, our neighbor to the south possesses a rich and complex cultural heritage. It has high, cool mountain regions, beautiful sandy ocean beaches, large stretches of desert, and tropical rain forests. Its capital, Mexico City, is the largest metropolitan area in the world, yet the country is largely rural, and many of its villages preserve their colonial characteristics. Mexicans are proud of their history and political independence, which can be seen in many museums and archeological sites throughout the country. Mexico is a country with masses of poor people, yet it is home to some of the richest families in the world. It has been home to highly developed indigenous civilizations dating back to at least 100BC.

Mexico has modern, high-tech industries and agricultural practices that coincide with craft industries that have changed little in the last 1000 years.Modernization in Mexico has taken on an international scope, as it has become one of the partners in the NAFTA agreement, and the country promotes a thriving tourist industry. The ever-present mixture of tradition and innovation makes a trip to Mexico an unforgettable experience.

THE J-TERM TRIP… will provide many examples of pre-columbian, colonial, and modern architecture and art; Mexican business and commerce, the educational system and agrarian practices; as well as religious and cultural centers in the cities of Mexico City, Taxco, Queretaro, Guanajuato, and Quadalajara. The trip concludes with several days on the sunny western coast of Mexico in Puerto Vallarta, where students can take advantage of a variety of optional seaside activities and excursions before returning home during the third week of January.

The Modern Language 376 course and three week Winter Interim tour of Mexico is open to students of all majors in their junior or senior year who have cumulative GPA of at least 2.5. Other students may be considered for the program, depending on enrollment figures.

This three credit course meets the University’s diversity requirement. Although students register for the course early in the fall semesters a J-term course, the evening seminars which prepare students of travel to Mexico meet during the preceding Fall semester.

Included in the cost of the course and tour are international fare and lodging, local transportation while in Mexico, entrance fees to all museums, historical sites and activities, insurance, and other miscellaneous expenses. Group travel rates and group discounts will be used whenever possible. Although costs vary from year to year, we will estimate the total will be about $2,500 for the 2006-2007 program.

Butler at kristine.butler@uwrf.edu or the club president to be included on the list and receive information on conversation tables, French Club excursions, interesting web sites, and French activities in the Twin Cities and St. Croix Valley area.

Tons! Not only are most of the things super fun to play with, they're great learning tools. Fluency in a second (or third, or fourth) language is becoming the number one selling point in the job market. The tools in the lab can help you boost your skill at both speaking and understanding another language. And when you're over in Qinghai Province or the Sudetenland you'll need some global awareness -- not to mention local awareness -- to communicate effectively. The newspapers, videos, and multimedia programs available in the lab can help you develop the skills you'll need, and build the knowledge base necessary in this ever-smaller world. Set aside some time in the lab to catch up on international news, to immerse yourself in a foreign culture, or to get Philippe and his girlfriend back together again (hey, apartment-hunting in Paris isn't all it's cracked up to be).

Where else can you fool around with big shiny circles? Take a close flyby of a chateau in the Loire Valley, help poor Philippe find an apartment after his girlfriend kicks him out, or stroll the streets of Vienna. The lab's getting more multimedia goodies all the time, and not just the laserdisc variety. The vocabulary builder CD-ROMs and Hypercard Stacks make "word torture" fun. You can look at the Eiffel Tower while figuring out the difference between a direct and an indirect object. They're a blast to use and if you're not careful you'll learn a lot too -- they're full of neat information. All of them run on Macintosh computers, so you can just point and click to make things happen.

Browse a Chinese newspaper or some German magazines. Peruse an impossibly vast collection of French novels. Hey, there's a coffeepot and some chairs right there, too. That's not enough for you? For the more serious student, there are lots of dictionaries and things. Punish yourself by writing the definition of faire over and over, or content yourself with just looking things up. There's a bunch of materials on Study Abroad, work abroad, and graduate programs, and plenty of stuff about opportunities like the Peace Corps and International Business. On top of everything, the lab is also a darn good study environment. Grab a cup of java, get comfortable, and hit some books.

The specific designation within a goal that a course is intended to satisfy (e.g. Communication (C)). The appropriate Appendix GE form(s) must be completed for each designator the course is intended to satisfy. One course cannot be used to satisfy more than one designator. So, if a course is approved for more than one designator, students will have to indicate which designator it will be used to satisfy.

Existing general education courses must be submitted to the General Education Committee for approval to be part of the new general education program; any course proposed for General Education credit must have gained approval from the College Curriculum Committee and the University Curriculum Committee at some time prior to submission to the General Education Committee.

There are three paths that lead to a course being considered by the General Education Committee for inclusion in the new program. The appropriate path hinges on the degree of change or development required to enable the course to conform to the new general education requirements.

Path 3: New Courses and Existing Courses with Significant and Substantive Changes Path 3, the standard approval process, applies to all new courses and existing courses for which there are significant and substantive changes. For these courses the path starts with consideration of the revised course within the relevant Department, followed by consideration of this course by the College Curriculum Committee, followed by consideration of the Dean of the College, followed by consideration by the University Curriculum Committee. If approved, the University Curriculum Committee will forward the transmittal form, course approval form, and appropriate Appendix GE form(s) to the General Education Committee.

Committee approves for inclusion in the general education program will, in general, be approved for up to five years. General education courses should be offered regularly during their approval period.

Committee will forward the relevant material to the Registrar for inclusion in the next course catalog. The Committee will also periodically publish an updated list of the approved general education program courses.

Once a standardized assessment process is developed and approved for each designator, courses for that designator will be expected to adopt that assessment process. The Committee expects sufficient information will be developed to objectively gauge the extent to which each general education course is achieving the desired outcomes.

In this initial process, courses will be granted approval for varying numbers of years so that the periodic reviews of general education courses can be staggered appropriately. THe number of years for which the course is approved is expected to be related to the completeness of the proposed assessment procedures.

Ethical Citizenship (EC), we must have agreement about the component of the learning outcome being measured (e.g. knowledge of material, support for ideas, writing quality, etc.), what kinds of student performance are to be measured (e.g. pre- and post-tests, writing assignments, examination questions, oral presentations, projects, etc.) and how those performances will be evaluated (e.g. setting a scale/rubric for assessing each of the identified components of performance with definitions for each level of performance).

Geography is the study of place, or space, in the same sense that history is the study of time. The geographer's method of inquiry concentrates on asking two essential questions: "WHERE are things located?" and "WHY are they located where they are?" While the answer to the former is largely descriptive, the answer to the latter is entirely analytical. The geographer is concerned primarily with interpreting and explaining the occurrence, distribution, and interrelationships of the physical and cultural elements which can be discerned in the landscape. Geography analyzes phenomena according to the attributes of dimension-succession. The constantly changing physical and human landscapes on the earth's surface challenge the geographer to provide continuing interpretations of all parts of the world form the spatial point of view. (Geography as a Discipline, Huke and Malmstrom, 1988).

Geographers perform a wide variety of jobs in geographic subfields such as cartography, geographic information systems, remote sensing, urban and regional planning, housing and community development, retail site location, computer mapping, environmental analysis, climatology and resource conservation. Most geographers work in four basic career fields: business, government, planning or teaching. Geographers collect and analyze data to search for solutions to a variety of spatial problems related to each subfield.

Dr. Dooley is actively pursuing research in both cartography and landscape archaeology, with specific focus on map uncertainty, multi-temporal processes, and human land-use in arid environments. Most recently, he has begun a collaborative research project using GIS and remote sensing tools to map locations bearing tool-stone used by pre-Columbian groups in southwestern Wyoming . During his free time, Dr. Dooley enjoys camping, backpacking, cycling, and spending time with his dog.

Dr. Heppen's teaching and research interests are in the human, political, and historical geography of the United States. He also likes to teach courses on Latin America and Asia. His primary research interests lie in changing electoral geographies as the result of new social and economic geographies due to the periodic restructuring of the American economy. He also has a research interest in the historical geography of the United States and past regional, political, and economic geographies. His major research methods include the statistical and spatial analysis of political, social, economic, and demographic data. He has conducted research at national and local scales including Louisiana, California, and the Midwest. Dr. Heppen enjoys mentoring students in their own research and working with them in exploring a wide range of geographic pursuits. He also has an interest in geographic education and serves as the faculty sponsor of the Student Geography Organization. In his spare time he enjoys sports, sports memorabilia, comic books, and railroads.

Dr. Petzold's teaching and research interests include weather and climate, climate-vegetation interactions (with a focus on sub-arctic lichens), northern environments and urban climates. He has spent several summers conducting research in Arctic and Sub-Arctic Canada and has authored several journal articles. He teaches courses primarily in physical geography including Physical Environments, Weather and Climate, Landforms, Advanced Climatology, Physical Environments of Urban Areas, the Geography of Plant and Animals, Environmental Education and the Geogaphy of Canada.

Dr. Petzold serves on a number of University and College committees. He is the coordinator of the Department's chapter of Gamma Theta Upsilon (the International Geography Honor Society), and is Secretary/Treasurer of the Wisconsin Geographical Society. Most recently, he has given a presentation at the annual meeting of the National Council for Geographic Education in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is currently compiling information on a book dealing with extreme environments.

Dr. Rader's research has focused on issues of cartographic representation and the use of GIS in groundwater vulnerability modeling. His other research has examined GIS and cartographic education. In 2003, he was a Wisconsin Teaching Scholar involved in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) and he has been active in mentoring undergraduate research projects.

Ms. Young's teaching interests include Human Geography, Cultural Geography, and the Geography of the US and Canada.

Alicia is a Land Use Specialist working with issues of Smart Growth through the University of Wisconsin - Extension in conjunction with departments of Geography & Mapping Sciences and Plant & Earth Science. She has experience as an Urban Stream Specialist with Medina County Soil and Water Conservation District and has served as the chairperson of the Stewardship Committee for the Medina Summit Land Conservancy.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are computer-based systems designed for the capture, management, manipulation, storage, analysis, and display of spatially referenced data. These systems are used to support decision making for planning an dmanagement problems. GIS allow a user to explore a wide variety of interactions between people, animals, plants, climate, resources, and other geographically based data in order to manage and understand better the world in which we live.

A fully networked laboratory houses the cartography and GIS hardware and software at UW-River Falls. This facility is fully integrated into the geography curriculum and features powerful computer hardware and software.

Internships are a prominent part of the Department of Geography and Mapping Sciences curriculum. Through internships students are provided with a chance to extend their classroom based experiences in the field working with professionals. Many of the internships center around the use of the students GIS and cartographic skills, but others have worked with planning and conservation agencies, doing field work, research, analyses, and report writing. Students develop internships in consultation with a faculty advisor and a sponsoring business or agency. For more information on the on internships please contact Charles Rader.

GEOGRAPHY is a field that uses an interdisciplinary approach to understand patterns of human activity and natural processes on the surface of the earth. Geographers are often called upon to analyze and solve problems that deal with interactions between people and the environment. Geography appeals to students who have a wide range of interests that involve human activities and their impacts on the natural environment.

Studying geography and mapping sciences at UWRF provides the skills to engage in a variety of careers. Through a combination of coursework and internships students gain first hand experience in geographic analysis.

The Degree Confluence Project is a quirky little site with "the goal of the project is to visit each of the latitude and longitude integer degree intersections in the world, and to take pictures at each location. The pictures and stories will then be posted here."

This is a wonderful, but sad, photo tour of industrial/commercial archeology of the Detroit area, including many historic old auto plants, no longer in use, but also showing in very graphic terms, the decay of downtown Detroit.

Department Weather Station.This page includes links to up-to-the-minute weather data from the rooftop of Kleinpell Fine Arts building including temperature, dew point, atmospheric pressure, wind direction and speed and rainfall.

Plan on going to Alaska next year and doing a moose hunt. Am actively involved in competitive shooting and marksmanship training. Starting to dabble in taxidermy a little bit. Would like to get back into photography a little again too. I am currently exploring those options. That's just a tid bit of what I've been up to. Hope to hear from any of the other people I went to school with. It's been a long time.

While at Ayres Associates I completed the required hydrogeology courses to receive the Wisconsin Hydrogeologist Certification. The projects that I am involved with include remedial site investigations, underground tank assessments, management of the ground water monitoring program, and unsaturated and saturated computer modeling.

I mostly work on sites with contamination (LUST sites, landfills, sludge, spills, all the yucky stuff). I really enjoy doing an occasional Phase I on a completely undeveloped farm field. I also spend a lot of time on administrative duties because I supervise 14 people (science is more fun!).

My job duties revolve around scouting for new rock resources, testing potential lands for rock resources, leasing, purchasing and buying land as well as designing operations and reclamation plans of our pits and quarries for permitting, which I do as well. I also take care of the environmental compliance issues for American. For fun I go to school at night to receive a Masters Degree in Business Administration..

Currently, I am living in Cheyenne, Wyoming where I work for the State Engineer's Office as a Water Management Specialist. My job has 2 main functions. The first is researching water rights (very important since water is scarce, especially during such a dry year). The second function is developing GIS projects, primarily focused on solving water rights issues.

Mesozioc thrust features in the "Central Nevada Thrust Belt". The central nevada thrust belt has been poorly mapped and the extent of the structures is poorly constrained both spacially and temporally. Thesis work will involve the "removal" of cenozoic Basin and range extension through balanced cross sections, fault kinematics, and detailed mapping.

I really like UND. It's a small graduate program, so it's very personal, kind of like UWRF with a graduate program. My thesis topic is natural attenuation of nitrate, or as it is called in the literature, denitrification. I've also just started working for ProSource Technologies, Inc. They have a one person (now 2!) office in Grand Forks. They are based in Coon Rapids. I'm working on a site that has a DNAPL plume next to the Red River, mostly coal tar. The project involves excavating 250,000 tons of contaminated soil, treating it with thermal desorbtion and filling the hole back in. It's in the area where the levee is being built to protect Grand Forks from another flood.

I am developing a new technique for mapping land forms on GIS using digital elevation models. The maps I am making are of glacial land forms that were produced by the Lake Michigan Lobe. Included in my mapping area is Eastern Wisconsin and parts of Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan.

Working with USGS reducing/interpreting gravity data from central and southern Wisconsin which will hopefully be a part of my Masters at Northern Illinois University. Also taking classes and I have a Teaching Assistantship at Northern.

Spouse: Mike. Graduate student at the University of Florida with a teaching assistantship and a research assistantship. What now: Working on my thesis: Sedimentary evidence of hurricanes in the salt marshes of St.Vincent Island, FL with Dr. John Jaeger.

This is a writing intensive course. This field trip exposes students to the geology of portions of Maine, New Brunswick and southern Quebec, especially the Gaspe Peninsula. Themes of this course include: geologic/tectonic processes and structures involved in continent building of the northern Appalachian Region, continental margin and marine sedimentology, and surficial/coastal geology. This trip also includes a distinct cultural educational experience by visiting French-speaking Quebec, including a stay in historical old Quebec City. Prerequisites: GEOL 102 and consent of instructor.

I have compiled an extensive data base on the minerals of Wisconsin cross-referenced by county and mineral.  Mineral entries are referenced to literature sources which are more thoroughly given in the bibliography database below.  If there are problems or questions, you can  E-MAIL  me, William S. Cordua. The Nov. - Dec. 1998 issue of Rocks and Minerals magazine contains a shorter version of this information  organized around a county-by-county listing of key mineral localities.

Education Needed:  Minimum is a B.S. or B.A. degree in geology. 	Optimum is a Master's degree in geology. Program should include significant mathematics, computer science, physics, 	chemistry and biology in addition to the core geology courses. A 	summer geology field course and/or internship is recommended.

In addition to the general education program of the University, the geology program includes required course work in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics and the "core" courses in geology:  We offer minors in hydrogeology and geology as well as several options such as environmental geology, engineering geology, oceanography, mineral exploration, petroleum geology.

An emphasis is not a minor.  You do not have to take all the courseslisted in one of the areas below.  An emphasis is a suggested series of courses that, in our opinion, fit together well and fit well with your geology major and that would help your career in the designated area.

Geology : Geology is the science of the earth. It is a dynamic and exciting field that deals with processes that cause constant change. Changes occur on all scales and at greatly varying rates. Entire continents move apart at a rate of a few inches a year, while earthquake generated ocean waves race across the Pacific at speeds up to 500 miles per hour! The chemicals within a mineral change on the atomic level, while volcanic eruptions may modify entire mountains.

With three clicks of the mouse the final grades are transferred to eSIS. The instructor logs into eSIS and navigates to their grade roster. The instructor clicks one button and the grades that were exported from D2L are brought into the Grade Input column of eSIS. The instructor confirms, Saves, and Approves their grades in eSIS.

What if I make a mistake on a grade: This process imports grades into eSIS but the instructor must Save and Approve those grades before the process is complete. An instructor can still change one or more grades in eSIS after the import and before the grades are approved.

Most instructors create their own grade schemes so they can define the exact grade cutoffs but a built-in scheme is also available for use. Instructors can also create a separate grade scheme to apply only to the final grade. It is acceptable to leave some student final grades empty in D2L as long as those grades are later entered in eSIS.

There is a three minute delay for the grades to arrive on campus and make it to an area for import to eSIS course grade roster. So, after grades are exported from D2L the instructor will have to wait no more than ten minutes, and possibly less. An email is automatically sent to the instructor when the grades arrive for import into eSIS.

Grades" button. Click it and the grades appear in the eSIS grade table. This process overwrites existing grades in the eSIS grade roster so any grades already entered in the grade roster will be replaced with whatever grade is being imported from D2L. This also means that instructors can import grades, return to D2L to make large-scale changes, and re-import the grades. It also means that an instructor can try it with just a few final grades and then come back and finish with all grades.

The structure of the D2L gradebook suggests that instructors can use either the Calculated grade or the Adjusted grade. For purposes of the eGrading process, that is not correct. The only grades that transfer are the letter grades associated with the Adjusted grades - letter grades associated with Calculated grades are never transferred.

I transfer my grades more than once? Yes, you can transfer grade files from D2L to eSIS as often as you like until the course grades are Approved and Posted in eSIS. Each time you import grades into an eSIS grade roster they replace previously existing grades. Remember, it might take as long as eight minutes before the new grades are ready in eSIS; wait for the email.

What if I have multiple sections in my D2L course? When you export grades from a D2L course all grades for all sections are included. Each class section in eSIS picks up the appropriate students and grades associated with that section.

Description: The Ethics Education in Science and Engineering (EESE) program considers proposals for research and educational projects to improve ethics education in all of the fields of science and engineering that NSF supports, including in interdisciplinary or inter-institutional contexts. Proposals must focus on improving ethics education for graduate students in those fields, or on developing summer post-baccalaureate ethics education activities or activities that transition students from undergraduate to graduate education. The program will entertain proposals in graduate ethics education in science and engineering generally, but is particularly interested in proposals addressing issues involving the international or global context and those addressing issues of intellectual property, including scientific publishing.

Description:  To provide grants or enter into cooperative agreements to improve postsecondary education opportunities by focusing on problem areas or improvement approaches in postsecondary education. Projects must include partners from the US, Canada, and Mexico.

Description: As part of its We the People initiative, NEH seeks proposals for a series of one-week residence-based workshops for K-12 educators that use historic sites to address central themes and issues in American history, government, literature, art history, or other related subjects in the humanities. The goals of the workshops are to: * provide teachers with training and experience in the use and interpretation of historical sites and the material resources and archival evidence of American history and culture; * increase knowledge and appreciation of places significant to American history and culture; and * encourage historical sites to develop greater capacity and scale for professional development programs. Workshops should be held at or near sites important to American history and culture (e.g., presidential residences or libraries, Colonial-era settlements, major battlefields, historic districts, and sites associated with major writers or artists). Applicants should make a compelling case for the historical significance of the site, the documents and material resources available for use, and the ways the site will enhance the workshop.

Description: The purpose of the USDA Biotechnology Risk Assessment Grants (BRAG) Program is to assist Federal regulatory agencies in making science-based decisions about the effects of introducing genetically modified organisms into the environment. Investigations of effects on both managed and natural environments are relevant. Applications to the USDA BRAG Program must seek partial funding for a conference or address one of the following areas: 1) Identify and develop practices to minimize risks associated with genetically engineered organisms; 2) Research methods to monitor the dispersal of genetically engineered organisms; 3) Research to increase knowledge about the characteristics, rates, and methods of gene transfer that may occur between genetically engineered organisms, and related organisms; 4) Perform assessments to provide analysis which compares impacts of organisms modified through genetic engineering to other types of production systems; 5) Other areas of research designed to further the purposes of the USDA BRAG program.

Description: Investments in the MSPA-MCS program aim to deepen support of collaborative research in fundamental mathematics and statistics, and computer science with a focus primarily on mathematical and statistical challenges posed by large data sets, managing and modeling uncertainty, and modeling complex nonlinear systems.

Description: With an emphasis on two-year colleges, the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program focuses on the education of technicians for the high-technology fields that drive our nation's economy. The program involves partnerships between academic institutions and employers to promote improvement in the education of science and engineering technicians at the undergraduate and secondary school levels. The ATE program supports curriculum development; professional development of college faculty and secondary school teachers; career pathways to two-year colleges from secondary schools and from two-year colleges to four-year institutions; and other activities. A secondary goal is articulation between two-year and four-year programs for K-12 prospective teachers that focus on technological education. The program also invites proposals focusing on applied research relating to technician education.

Description:  The National Research Council provides awards to scientists and engineers at all stages of their careers to conduct independent research in federal laboratories and affiliated institutions. Awards include arrtactive stipends, health insurance, professional travel, and relocation.

Description: The GOALI initiative aims to synergize university-industry partnerships by making funds available to support an eclectic mix of industry-university linkages. Special interest is focused on affording the opportunity for: (1) faculty, postdoctoral fellows and students to conduct research and gain experience with production processes in an industrial setting, (2) industrial scientists and engineers to bring industry's perspective and integrative skills to academe, and (3) interdisciplinary university-industry teams to conduct long-term projects. This initiative targets high-risk/high-gain research with a focus on fundamental topics that would not have been undertaken by industry, new approaches to solving generic problems, development of innovative collaborative industry-university educational programs, and direct transfer of new knowledge between academe and industry.

To meet this objective, the GOALI program provides funding, for example, for faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and students to develop creative modes of collaborative interactions with industry through individual or small-group projects, and industry-based fellowships for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.

You are not limited to these theme areas, however; they welcome original, innovative and hypothesis-driven proposals that deal with the Great Lakes or oceans regardless of their relationship to national theme areas (for examples, see Innovative Science & Technology theme). They are also interested in imaginative outreach and education proposals that complement the program priorities, and are especially interested in receiving proposals from female, minority and new faculty.

Description: Information technologies are integral to both the workplace and everyday activities of most Americans. They are part of how people learn, how they interact with each other and information, and how they represent and understand their world. Attaining a basic understanding of these technologies and mastery of essential technical skills is a requirement for anyone to benefit from innovation in the modern world. The technological growth of the nation depends on a technologically literate citizenry. ITEST is designed to increase the opportunities for students and teachers to learn about, experience, and use information technologies within the context of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including Information Technology (IT) courses. It is in direct response to the concern about shortages of information technology workers in the United States. Supported projects are intended to provide opportunities for middle and high school children and teachers to build the skills and knowledge needed to advance their study, and to function and to contribute in a technologically rich society. Additionally, exposure to engaging applications of IT is a means to stimulate student interest in the field and an important precursor to the academic preparation needed to pursue IT careers. The ITEST program seeks projects that demonstrate innovative and creative applications of IT in school and non-school contexts and is committed to preparing learners to benefit from and contribute to the growing national cyberinfrastructure.

Description: The Environmental Sustainability program supports engineering research with the goal of promoting sustainable engineered systems that support human well-being and that also are compatible with sustaining natural (environmental) systems, which provide ecological services vital for human survival. The long-term viability of natural capital is critical for many areas of human endeavor, including agriculture, industry, and tourism. Research in Environmental Sustainability considers long time horizons and incorporates contributions from the social sciences and ethics.

Improvements in distribution and collection systems that will advance smart growth strategies and ameliorate effects of growth are research areas that are supported by Environmental Sustainability. Innovations in storm water management, wastewater technology, indoor air quality, recycling and reuse of drinking water, and other green engineering techniques to support sustainable construction projects also may be fruitful areas for research.

Description: The Energy for Sustainability program supports fundamental research and education in energy production, conversion, and storage and is focused on energy sources that are environmentally friendly and renewable. Most world energy needs are currently met through the combustion of fossil fuels. With projected increases in global energy needs, more sustainable methods for energy production will need to be developed, and production of greenhouse gases will need to be reduced.

Sources of sustainable energy include sunlight, wind, and biomass. Hydrogen and alcohols are potential energy carriers that can be derived from renewable sources. Research to produce and store hydrogen for use in direct combustion or in fuel cells is supported by the program. Potential sources of hydrogen include conversion from biomass and from electrolysis, photolysis or thermolysis of water. Biomass is available from agricultural crops and residues, forest products, aquatic plants, and municipal wastes. In addition to hydrogen, biomass can be a source of liquid, solid and gaseous fuels including biofuels such as ethanol. Fuel cells have the potential to convert fuels such as hydrogen and alcohols to electricity at high efficiencies and should play an increasing role in energy conversion. Critical components of low temperature fuel cells requiring additional research include catalysts, membranes, and electrolytes.

Projects should: (1) address a State, regional, national, or international educational need; (2) involve a creative or non-traditional approach toward addressing that need that can serve as a model to others; (3) encourage and facilitate better working relationships in the university science and education community, as well as between universities and the private sector, to enhance program quality and supplement available resources; and (4) result in benefits that will likely transcend the project duration and USDA support.

Description: The Biotechnology (BTEC) program deals with problems involved in economic processing and manufacturing of products of economic importance by effectively utilizing renewable resources of biological origin and bioinformatics originating from genomic and proteomic information. The BTEC program supports research projects that are primarily interdisciplinary and involve multiple investigators consisting of closely collaborating engineers and biological scientists. The BTEC program emphasizes basic engineering and biological research that advances the fundamental knowledge base that contributes to a better understanding of biomolecular processes (in vivo, in vitro, and/or ex vivo) and eventually to the development of generic enabling technology and practical application. Quantitative assessments of bioprocesses and their rates at the levels of gene regulation and expression, signal transduction pathways, posttranslational protein processing, enzymes in reaction systems, metabolic pathways, cells and tissues in cultivation, biological systems including animal, plant, microbial and insect cells, etc. are considered vital to the successful research projects in the BTEC program.

Research projects supported through the BTEC program include, but are not limited to, fermentation technology, enzyme technology, recombinant DNA technology, cell culture technology, ex vivo and therapeutic stem cell culture technology, metabolic pathway engineering, biosensor development, bioreactor design and bioprocess optimization, bioseparation and purification processes, bioprocess optimization and integration, monitoring and control of bioprocesses, food processing with special focus on the safety of the nation's food supply, tissue engineering, information technology relevant to biotechnology including bioinformatics, nanobiotechnology and biomimetics, and quantitative systems biotechnology.

The MRI program assists in the acquisition or development of major research instrumentation by organizations that is, in general, too costly for support through other NSF programs. Proposals may be for a single instrument, a large system of instruments, or multiple instruments that share a common or specific research focus.

Description: The Biological Physics program supports projects in which the analytical and experimental tools of physics are applied to the study of problems originating in the living world. Both experimental and theoretical projects will be considered, although the main focus of the program is in the experimental area. Of particular interest are projects in which new experimental approaches are brought to bear on a well-identified problem. These approaches should at the same time have the potential for broad applicability to a set of similar problems, thereby adding to the set of tools the scientist has for addressing biological problems in general. While the problems under study must be important to advancing understanding of the living world in a meaningful way, particular emphasis will be placed on those projects in which the lessons learned from the application serve to foster new concepts and ideas that expand the intellectual basis of physics. The program funds individual investigators, although collaborative proposals between physicists and biologists are welcome.

Description: Proposals are sought for research into alternative methods of solid waste disposal, including the reduction of the amount of solid waste generated, the reuse and recycling of materials, composting, source separation and the disposal of household hazardous waste. Research proposals may consider the environmental effects of the technologies being researched and measures which could be taken to mitigate such effects. Applied research, designed to provide benefits to persons who generate solid waste and to public and private entities responsible for collection, storage, transportation, treatment or disposal of solid waste, is encouraged. Proposals are also sought for projects that will develop products or increase markets for products made from recycled materials. Grants of up to $30,000 are available.

Joint proposals in which industrial, business, or governmental organizations collaborate with UW System faculty or staff in addressing these issues are especially encouraged and are given special consideration. In such joint proposals, the organization is strongly encouraged to provide resources in the form of direct monetary or in-kind contributions in support of the proposed research projects.

Description: NSF's Networking Technology and Systems (NeTS) program solicits proposals from the networking research and education community, encouraging investigators to make bold assumptions about the future of networking. The scope of the program covers all properties of information networks including network architecture, protocols, algorithms, and proof of concept implementation of hardware and software. Research activities include creation of new network architectures, modeling of phenomena, network design, analysis, measurement, and performance evaluation. The research scope of the program spans many types of networks that include end-to-end complex wide-area networks and sub-networks including local area networks, ad hoc networks, sensor networks, vehicular networks, and optical networks. It also includes research on heterogeneous networks that are hybrids of two or more types of sub-networks.

NeTS supports the development of innovative curricular materials that have the potential to significantly improve higher education in networking technology and systems areas, particularly in emerging areas or topics that benefit from NeTS research results. Education-focused activities may be submitted as stand-alone projects or as components of broader research and education projects. Stand-alone curriculum development projects are expected to include strong justification for the need for new materials and must include plans both for disseminating them to the community and for evaluating their effectiveness. Proposals that solely focus on education must be discussed with a NeTS Program Officer prior to submission.

Description: The Business and International Education program provides grants to enhance international business education programs and to expand the capacity of the business community to engage in international economic activities.

Description: The Science of Design (SoD) Program at NSF solicits proposals for projects that will bring creative, scientific advances to the design of software artifacts and systems. Design is a topic of great interest in many fields; the goal of the SoD Program is to advance design research and education to meet the critical software design challenges of the 21st century. The objective of the program is to bring new paradigms, concepts, approaches, models, and theories into the development of a strong intellectual foundation for software design, which will ultimately improve the processes of constructing, evaluating, and modifying software-intensive systems. This body of knowledge needs to be intellectually rigorous, formalized where appropriate, supported by empirical evidence where possible, open to creative, artistic expression, and above all, teachable.

Future software-intensive systems will be vastly different from those in use today. Revolutionary advances in hardware, networking, and human interface technologies will require entirely new ways of thinking about how software systems are conceptualized, built, understood, and evaluated. As we envision the future of complex distributed computing environments, innovative research is needed to provide the scientific foundations for managing issues of complexity, quality, cost, and human intellectual control of software design and development. To these ends, importing and adapting ideas from other design fields (engineering, biology, architecture, economics, and the arts, for example) are encouraged. Similarly, it is critical that software design researchers work across different areas within computer science to insure that design includes the interdependencies of software with other systems artifacts, such as complex data structures and data repositories. Thus, continuations of current lines of research or research to incrementally extend current software design methods are unlikely to be competitive in this solicitation.

While proposals from individual researchers will be considered by the SoD program, this year the program's focus will be on interdisciplinary team projects. Each proposal should provide a convincing argument that the proposed research is innovative and unique in its contribution to the Science of Design discipline, including careful reference to the literature. Selected projects will be funded for durations and at levels commensurate with the size of the team and the nature of the research. Larger projects typically will be funded for up to 3 years at levels of up to $300,000 per year. Investigators who wish to submit proposals that exceed these parameters must receive prior permission to do so from an SoD program officer.

The CSR program also supports projects that expand the capabilities of computer systems by exploiting the potential of new technologies or by developing innovative new ways to use existing technologies. CSR-funded projects will strive to make significant progress on challenging high-impact problems, as opposed to incremental progress on familiar problems. To be successful, CSR proposals must have credible plans for demonstrating the utility and potential impact of the proposed work.

Projects designed to recruit and retain students during the critical transition from high-school to college are highly appropriate for consideration by the GeoEd Program.  Proposals should describe a plan to initiate or pilot innovative geoscience education activities. Track 1 projects should integrate research and education. Proposals for projects that will make use of current geoscience research results and/or methods are sought, as are proposals that will promote the geosciences and geoscience careers as highly relevant to modern society. Projects that are informed by the results of current education-related research or will conduct new educational research within a geoscience education venue will be considered under this solicitation. Awards are intended to provide start-up or proof-of-concept funding to enable projects to reach a level of maturity that will allow them to compete for longer-term funding from other sources or become self-sustaining. All proposed projects should have strong evaluation and dissemination plans.

Description: The Innovation and Organizational Change (IOC) program supports scientific research directed at advancing understanding of innovation and organizational phenomena. Levels of analysis may include (but are not limited to) individuals, groups and/or institutional arrangements. Research may involve industrial, educational, service, government, not-for-profits, voluntary organizations or interorganizational arrangements.

IOC-funded research must be grounded in theory, relevant to an operational or applied context, and generalizable. It must advance our scientific understanding of innovation and organizations. Proposals that aim to implement or evaluate innovations or particular organizational changes rather than to advance fundamental, generalizable knowledge about innovation and organizations are not appropriate for IOC.

Synthesis Research and Evaluation Project proposals should identify areas where the knowledge base in either evaluation or research is sufficiently robust to support strong scientific claims, identify areas of importance to education research and practice, and propose rigorous methods for synthesizing findings and drawing conclusions. Proposals for workshops and other meetings are permitted.

Empirical Research and Evaluation Project proposals should identify areas that have the potential for advancing discovery and innovation at the frontiers of STEM learning. These proposals are expected to be based deeply in the STEM disciplines and be theoretically and methodologically strong with the potential of contributing to theory, methodology, and practice.

For either type of proposal, areas of interest include behavioral, cognitive, social, and technological aspects of learning and education; learning in formal and informal settings; diffusion, implementation, and the role of context in educational and learning innovations; and theoretical, methodological, and statistical issues of importance in advancing research and evaluation. Investigators from across the broad range of disciplines supported by the NSF are invited to submit proposals. Interdisciplinary proposals are particularly welcome.

Description: The purpose of the NRI Program is to support research, extension, and education grants that address key problems of national, regional, and multistate importance in sustaining all components of agriculture (farming, ranching, forestry including urban and agroforestry, aquaculture, rural communities, human nutrition, processing, etc.). Providing this support requires that NRI advance fundamental sciences in support of agriculture and coordinate opportunities to build on these discoveries. Building on these discoveries will necessitate new efforts in education and extension that deliver science-based knowledge to people, allowing them to make informed practical decisions. In FY 2007, the NRI Program will accept applications for fundamental research, mission-linked research, and integrated research, extension, and education projects.

Integrated research, extension, and education grants bring together the three components of the agricultural knowledge system (research, education, and extension) around a problem or activity. In FY 2006, the NRI is seeking to support projects that bring together at least two of these components. Eligibility and requirements for matching funds and types of projects differ by application type.

Training from these institutions will give Mexican participants the skills and the collaborative links necessary for them to respond more effectively to development challenges and opportunities.

Description: The goal of the Undergraduate Biology and Mathematics (UBM) activity is to enhance undergraduate education and training at the intersection of the biological and mathematical sciences and to better prepare undergraduate biology or mathematics students to pursue graduate study and careers in fields that integrate the mathematical and biological sciences. The core of the activity is long-term research experiences for interdisciplinarily balanced teams of at least four undergraduates. Projects should focus on research at the intersection of the mathematical and biological sciences. Projects should provide students exposure to contemporary mathematics and biology, addressed with modern research tools and methods. That is, projects must be genuine research experiences rather than rehearsals of research methods. Projects must involve students from both areas in collaborative research experiences and include joint mentorship by faculty in both fields. In addition, it is expected that projects will strengthen the research and education capacity, infrastructure, and culture of the participating institutions. To this end, projects should create models for education in the mathematical and biological sciences and influence the direction of academic programs for a broad range of students. UBM is a joint effort of the Education and Human Resources (EHR), Biological Sciences (BIO), and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Directorates at the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Description: ITEST is designed to increase the opportunities for students and teachers to learn about, experience, and use information technologies within the context of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including Information Technology (IT) courses. It is in direct response to the concern about shortages of information technology workers in the United States. Supported projects are intended to provide opportunities for both school-age children and for teachers to build the skills and knowledge needed to advance their study, and to function and contribute in a technologically rich society.

Youth-based projects with strong emphases on career and educational paths that include a summer component. Projects should include activities (after-school and/or weekends) that focus on IT or IT-intensive STEM subject areas. Projects may include the creation of new instructional materials or may adopt or adapt existing curriculum materials and tools, including software, for use in an informal science education environment. Creation of innovative and creative models for engaging students in meaningful learning experiences is a priority. For the purposes of ITEST, the definition of informal learning is that it is voluntary, and primarily self-directed and independent learning.

Comprehensive projects for students and teachers, infusing appropriate information technologies into STEM courses so as to expand IT experiences that are commonly available in schools. Development of teacher materials on information technologies is encouraged, whether linked to core STEM courses or providing a broader range of resources and applications. Provision of opportunities for teachers to put into practice what they have learned via summer laboratory experiences with students, grades 7-12, is expected.

Energy efficient technologies will enhance the competitive position of the Nation's Chemical Industry by lowering manufacturing costs and providing new opportunities for chemical product manufacture in regions where energy or environmental costs were formerly considered prohibitive. Proposed projects are expected to improve energy intensity by at least 30% over existing systems. The threshold for energy savings should be 5 trillion BTUs per year by 2030, and ideally the project should yield energy savings in excess of 5 trillion BTUs per year by 2030 when fully commercialized across the industry, while maintaining the level of energy intensity stated above.

Research proposals must address one or more of the following areas: Waste Reduction, Reuse, Recycling, Composting, Solid Waste Disposal or Disposal of Household Hazardous Waste. Students in the liberal arts are encouraged to develop proposals concerning waste streams or issues common in their field. For example, an art major might investigate waste reduction and reuse options for different materials such as wood, glass, paints, solvents or glazes. Business or economics majors could assess markets for specific recyclable materials or develop a cost benefit analysis of different collection methods. A student majoring in sociology or geography might investigate physical or social relationships within the waste management industry (e.g. correlation between income levels and community recycling participation rates). Two or three students may work together and submit one proposal. This allows students to combine the skills of their respective disciplines in one project. Special consideration will be given to proposals that collaborate with Wisconsin Industries or municipalities.

All proposed projects should have strong evaluation and dissemination plans.

Description: These two grants support projects that improve specific areas of humanities education and serve as national models of excellence. Projects must draw upon scholarship in the humanities and use scholars and teachers as advisers. NEH is especially interested in projects that offer solutions to problems frequently encountered by teachers. Projects may help schools, colleges, and universities develop (or revise) and implement significant humanities programs, curricula, courses, and materials for teaching and learning; or develop materials and tools for classrooms that enhance the acquisition of advanced knowledge and understanding of the humanities, especially materials that apply to digital technologies.

Support is available for two types of projects: curriculum development and materials development. Since they have different goals and products, applicants should choose carefully the type of grant most appropriate for their proposed project.

Curriculum development projects typically bring together faculty within an institution or from cooperating schools, colleges, and universities to prepare, implement, and evaluate new or revised curricula that can serve as models for humanities teachers nationwide. These projects often involve collaboration among schools and institutions of higher education or organizations such as libraries or museums and regional and national consortia.

Materials development projects involve groups of teachers and scholars working collaboratively to create resources, such as sourcebooks, document collections, or teaching guides, on specific humanities topics and texts. The development of the materials should have a significant impact on humanities instruction nationwide. Such materials may use print or electronic formats, but the preparation of traditional textbooks is ineligible for funding.

As part of a project, applicants may design, produce, and test interactive educational software and other electronic technologies. Projects involving digital materials must run on multiple platforms and must include provisions for long-term access and maintenance.

Foreign applicants must either be based at a U.S. institution or plan to carry out their work in the United States. Amounts will depend on travel costs, but will ordinarily be in the range of several hundred dollars up to about $5000. Grants are payable to the individual applicant. Lewis and Clark Fund grants are taxable income, but the Society is not required to report payments. It is recommended that grant recipients discuss their reporting obligations with their tax advisors.

One goal of the CISE Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI) program is to provide infrastructure that enables high-quality computing research and education. A second goal is to extend the set of individuals and departments that are able to conduct such activities. The CRI program is committed to maintaining a broad portfolio that supports research and education across a diverse population and lessens the digital divide. The program encourages proposals that are from or that include minority-serving institutions.

The CRI program will support a variety of infrastructure needs, such as general or specialized research equipment, technical support, and/or software. CRI will also support the development of infrastructure that can be used by others, such as data archives or libraries of software tools. The primary criteria are that the infrastructure facilitates the conduct of high-quality research and related education, and that it cannot be acquired or developed without funding resources beyond those available from individual research and education grants and the host institution.

Planning . These awards facilitate the preparation of a proposal for a medium or large infrastructure acquisition grant. They have budgets up to $50,000 for one institution or up to $100,000 if more than one institution is involved.

Description: Microorganisms are the oldest, most diverse and most abundant forms of life on Earth. However, the identity, physiology and interactions of the vast majority of these microbes, as well as the processes they mediate in the environment, remain unknown or poorly understood. Advances in molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics, and cultivation technologies herald a new age of exploration of the microbial world. The Microbial Observatories (MO) and Microbial Interactions and Processes (MIP) activities will support research to discover and characterize novel microorganisms, microbial consortia, communities, activities and other novel properties, and to study their roles in diverse environments.

The Microbial Observatories activity is a continuation of MO competitions held since 1999 (for a list of prior awards, see http://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/awards/mo.htm ). The long-term goal of this activity is to develop a network of sites or "microbial observatories" in different habitats to study and understand microbial diversity over time and across environmental gradients. Projects supported are expected to establish or participate in an established, Internet-accessible knowledge network to disseminate information resulting from these activities. In addition, educational and outreach activities such as formal or informal training in microbial biology, and activities that will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in microbial research and education are expected. Beginning with the October 2005 target date, the USDA/CSREES will partner with NSF to support MO projects relevant to agroecosystems.

Microbial Interactions and Processes (MIP) expands the range of the MO competition to support microbial diversity research projects that need not be site-based, and that are smaller and/or shorter in duration than MO projects. MIP projects will be considered for funding by NSF only. This expanded activity will fund integrative studies that explore novel microorganisms, their interactions in consortia and communities, and aspects of their physiology, biochemistry and genomics in relationship to the processes that they carry out in the environment.

The objective of the International Research Fellowship Program (IRFP) is to introduce scientists and engineers in the early stages of their careers to research opportunities abroad, thereby furthering NSF's goal of creating a diverse, competitive, and globally-engaged U.S. workforce of scientists, engineers, technologists and well-prepared citizens. These awards are available in any field of science and engineering research and education supported by NSF.

As directed by State Statutes [Sec. 94.64 (8m)], proposals should outline an applied research study that addresses a component of a problem in the areas of soil management, soil fertility, or plant nutrition; or that addresses groundwater and surface water problems that may be related to fertilizer usage. Funds can also be used for other designated activities that promote the correct usage of fertilizer materials and can be used to disseminate the results of research.

Researchers from the University of Wisconsin system are eligible to apply. Approximately $100,000 is available to support research projects each year. Average funding for new proposals in 2005 was $13,000. The council lists nine areas of requested research (see website), but will welcome proposals on other topics that fit their goals and criteria.

Description: The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in any of the areas of research funded by the National Science Foundation. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects designed especially for the purpose.

There are two mechanisms for support of student research: (1) REU Sites are based on independent proposals to initiate and conduct projects that engage a number of students in research. REU Sites may be based in a single discipline or academic department, or on interdisciplinary or multi-department research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme. Proposals with an international dimension are welcome. A partnership with the Department of Defense supports REU Sites in DoD-relevant research areas. (2) REU Supplements may be requested for ongoing NSF-funded research projects or may be included as a component of proposals for new or renewal NSF grants or cooperative agreements.

As part of the requirements for funding, projects must show how collected data will be shared broadly with the scientific community and the interested public.

Description: The W.K. Kellogg Foundation provides support for projects guided by its mission: to help people help themselves through the practical application of knowledge and resources to improve their quality of life and that of future generations. Grants are giving in four areas: health; food systems and rural development; youth and education; and philanthropy and volunteerism. Grants are made in three geographic regions: United States; Southern Africa; and Latin American and the Caribbean. Funding varies from proposal to proposal.

The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is an NSF-wide activity that offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of the early career-development activities of those teacher-scholars who most effectively integrate research and education within the context of the mission of their organization. Such activities should build a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions to research and education. NSF encourages submission of CAREER proposals from junior faculty members at all CAREER-eligible organizations and especially encourages women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities to apply.

Description: The Teacher Professional Continuum (TPC) program addresses critical issues and infrastructure needs regarding the recruitment, preparation, induction, retention, and life-long development of K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers. Its goals are to improve the quality and coherence of teacher learning experiences across the continuum through research that informs teaching practice and the development of innovative resources for the professional development of K-12 STEM teachers.

The Foundation was established in December 2003 with an initial endowment of $10 million in response to both the current environment in the markets and a survey conducted by NASD that showed that investors still have a number of fundamental questions and misunderstandings about important investment issues. The Foundation awards grants to fund educational programs and research aimed at segments of the investing public who could benefit from additional resources.

Note: CCLI has changed dramatically from previous versions, though the new configuration may continue to support the kinds of activities previous competitions have supported. Deadlines have changed, also. See the webpage for details.

Description: The Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB) Program is designed to enable institutions to create programs that will encourage undergraduate students, especially those from under-represented groups, to pursue a career in environmental biology. The UMEB Program supports projects that provide year-round support for undergraduate students to gain research experience in environmental biology. Environmental biology is broadly defined to include areas of research focusing on organisms as they evolve, interact with each other, and/or interact with their environment, from perspectives that range from molecular to ecosystem levels. Environmental biology also includes molecular studies of environment-organism interactions and environmental genomics. Field experience must be part of the research experience. Projects should emphasize factors that encourage and enable members of under-represented groups to enter, and remain in, environmental biology.

Description: The Office of Professional and Instructional Development announces that support will again be available for development and sponsorship of local, regional, and systemwide workshops and conferences focused on the improvement of teaching. The Conference Development Grants Program emphasizes collaboration among faculty, staff, departments, and institutions. The program typically funds workshops, seminars, and conferences that bring UW System faculty and staff together to work collaboratively on issues in undergraduate education.

The grants are intended to support travel, materials, and some expenses incidental to the event; they are not  intended to support conference travel for individual faculty members attending non-OPID-funded events. Grant proposals may request up to $1,000. We ask that OPID administrative representatives sign off on proposals submitted by their institutions.

Description: The Division of Chemistry of the National Science Foundation (NSF), under the umbrella of the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program (CRIF), has provided support to research institutions and consortia for the establishment of regional or national instrumentation facilities, the purchase of departmental research instrumentation, and the development of state-of-the-art equipment. With this solicitation, the instrumentation facilities component of the CRIF Program is expanded to address the growing importance of cyber-enabled chemistry in the research endeavor. The Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Cyberinfrastructure and Research Facilities (CRIF:CRF) Program provides funding to build a foundation for cyber-enabled chemical research and education; and to establish and support multi-user instrumentation research facilities with unique capabilities in the chemical sciences. This is structured to enable NSF, through its Division of Chemistry, to respond to a variety of needs for infrastructure to support basic research and education in chemistry. NSF programs that support cyberinfrastructure, instrumentation, and facilities for other fields of research are listed in the solicitation.

Description: The Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) activity supports research by faculty members of predominantly undergraduate institutions through the funding of (1) individual and collaborative research projects, (2) the purchase of shared-use research instrumentation, and (3) Research Opportunity Awards for work with NSF-supported investigators at other institutions. All NSF directorates participate in the RUI activity. RUI proposals are evaluated and funded by the NSF programs in the disciplinary areas of the proposed research. Eligible "predominantly undergraduate" institutions include U.S. two-year, four-year, masters-level, and small doctoral colleges and universities that (1) grant baccalaureate degrees in NSF-supported fields, or provide programs of instruction for students pursuing such degrees with institutional transfers (e.g., two-year schools), (2) have undergraduate enrollment exceeding graduate enrollment, and (3) award an average of no more than 10 Ph.D. or D.Sc. degrees per year in all NSF-supportable disciplines. Autonomous campuses in a system are considered independently, although they may be submitting their proposals through a central office. A Research Opportunity Award is usually funded as a supplement to the NSF grant of the host researcher, and the application is submitted by the host institution.

Description: Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) is a voluntary program intended to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies while leveraging Federal investment in environmental enhancement and protection, in conjunction with agricultural production. Under CIG, Environmental Quality Incentives Program funds are used to award competitive grants to non-Federal governmental or non-governmental organizations, Tribes, or individuals. CIG enables NRCS to work with other public and private entities to accelerate technology transfer and adoption of promising technologies and approaches to address some of the Nation's most pressing natural resource concerns. CIG will benefit agricultural producers by providing more options for environmental enhancement and compliance with Federal, State, and local regulations. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers CIG.

Extension Initiative (OREI). ORG funds the development and implementation of research, extension and higher education programs to improve the competitiveness of organic producers and producers who are adopting organic practices. OREI funds research and extension programs that enhance the ability of producers and processors who have already adopted organic standards to grow and market high quality organic agricultural products.

Research projects should involve global or trans-regional phenomena. We expect that most applicants will be from history, literature, art history, cultural studies, anthropology, or related disciplines. All prospective applicants should be committed to dialogue and exchange with scholars working on areas other than their own, and to participation in formal and informal conversations that cross disciplines and fields.

Minority Faculty Research Awards--to provide released time and support to tenure-track, minority faculty members for their scholarly research and writing, thus enhancing their opportunities for achieving tenure.

Description: The Scientific Cooperation Research Program (SCRP) funds long-term and short-term international collaborative research and exchanges that address concerns for food security, environmental stewardship, and agricultural trade. Successful proposals focus on the mutual strategic goals of USDA and its worldwide partners. SCRP projects promote the enhancement of agricultural producers' economic opportunities, protection from agricultural pests and diseases, food safety, nutrition and health, rural quality of life, and the environment.

SCRP international research and scientific exchanges complement USDA's domestic programs while also contributing to U.S. international commitments. Joint projects support economic development and trade capacity building and expand market opportunities for agricultural, fish, and forest products.

Scientific Cooperation Exchange Program with the People's Republic of China - A unique program with China offers an excellent opportunity for U.S. teams of up to 5 members to initiate linkages with potential long-term collaborators at Chinese institutions throughout that country. Under a special USDA Scientific Technological Exchange Agreement with the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture specifically tailors two-week visits to China to meet the scientific objectives of each team. U.S. teams are responsible only for their international airfare to and from China.

UWRF subscribes to two web-basedservices that will perform regular, automatic searches for you. You must first create a profile, which tells the search engine what sorts of grant opportunities interest you. After that, the program will email grant opportunities that fit your profile directly to you. In our experience, only a small fraction of the opportunities they send will be of interest. But, on the other hand, it takes only a few seconds to review their emails and the payoff can be enormous. If an automated search results in a single grant, it's worth that small investment of your time.

FedGrants, a federally supported service (created and run by the Dept of Health and Human Services) that lists grants offered by most federal agencies. You can ask it to send you every federal grant opportunity, every opportunity with a particular program number or listed by a specific agency (not recommended), or "all notices from selected interest and eligibility groups"--the one most likely to work for you.

To help faculty and staff obtain external funding. Funding can come from a variety of sources--agencies of the federal government, UW-System, foundations, corporations, and so on. Funding can support a variety of activities--instructional support or improvement, curricular reform, research, faculty development, etc. Individuals, groups of individuals, departments, colleges, the university as a whole, or consortia of universities can seek funding. The Office of Grants and Research will assist any of these entities in obtaining funding from any of these sources.

To help faculty and staff manage the grants they receive and manage their research. The Office of Grants and Research works closely with the Accounting Office to make sure that funds are being disbursed according to the approved budget and with the funding agency to make sure that they are kept informed of grant activities. The Director of Grants and Research serves as staff to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and to the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects; those committees ensure that research involving animals or humans at UW-River Falls is performed ethically.

Grants can be wonderful. They can liberate you from the drudgery of your ordinary life and allow you to carry out new, exciting, productive activities which will revitalize you professionally and personally. They can also be terrible. When applications are poorly planned, written, or managed they can doom you to new sorts of drudgery without relieving you of the old; they can embroil you in ongoing disputes with grantors elsewhere or with your colleagues at home; they can complicate your life in ways you do not wish to bear. At best, poorly written applications disappoint you when they fail.

The purpose of this booklet is to help you win grants which turn out to be wonderful. It outlines the responsibilities of the Office of Grants and Research and the services this office can provide; gives some guidelines for searching for sources and writing proposals; and describes the procedures you should follow in applying for grants.

This booklet also contains the approval form you must use to obtain the necessary institutional signatures on a grant application and the questionnaire which the Grants Office uses to build a database of faculty interests. Tear them off to use them; if you need more, photocopy at will, or call us for more forms.

The quest for grant funds usually begins with an idea. "I have an idea for improving our department's curriculum by incorporating writing into every course", or, "I think I know why frammises rotate counterclockwise; I'd like to check it out." The next step is to find some potential funding sources.

The Grants Office can help. We maintain a small library of grant resource documents: several newsletters, The Foundation Directory, guides to foundations in Wisconsin and Minnesota, guides to funding in specific areas, and so on. A growing number of grant sources are available electronically.

Sometimes faculty or staff will come across a source which will stimulate an idea. You may hear about writing-across-the-curriculum grants at a faculty development workshop, and thereby generate an idea for overhauling your introductory course. Or you might read about a new federal research program in the Frammis Review and remember the brainstorming you did in grad school on frammis rotation. The Grants Office can help you by requesting the guidelines for applications, serving as a sounding board for your nascent idea, and searching for alternative sources in case the first one doesn't work out.

We compile all of the opportunities which might be of interest to someone at UW-RF from the various newsletters, magazines, notices, etc., we receive, write brief descriptions, print them in a newsletter, and send it around.

We also maintain a local database of faculty interests. We sift likely opportunities through that database for matches and send out copies of the opportunity to interested faculty and staff almost instantly. The questionnaire which we use to survey faculty and staff interests for our database is attached; please fill it out and return it to the Grants Office, 104 North Hall. If we have your interests on file in our database we will send you information about grant opportunities which match your interests as soon as they come in. Otherwise you'll have to wait for the monthly newsletter.

The Solution. Second, show how you will solve this problem. Describe your project step by step, taking pains to demonstrate how each step will address the problem and promote a solution. Provide whatever information the reader will need to be persuaded, and no more.

Evaluation. Third, describe how you will evaluate whether or not your solution solves the problem. Most sources require an extensive evaluation section. For those that don't, include it anyway; the readers will be impressed that you are thinking that far ahead. Evaluations can be formal or informal, formative or summative, internal or external, depending on the project and the funding source. Make sure that your system of evaluation will, in fact, demonstrate that the need described in the first part was addressed by the solution you propose in the second.

Budget. Many reviewers look at the budget first, before they read the narrative. They assume that the budget shows what the proposal is all about in just a few pages. Consequently, your budget should serve as a brief summary of your project: detailed enough to give a clear idea, but concise enough to hold the reviewer's attention. The various items in the budget should follow the same order as the activities you propose in the narrative.

There should be a clear, easily discernible relationship between these four parts. The problem section should focus on a particular need, the solution section should outline a specific series of activities which will address that need, the evaluation section should outline a method of evaluating how the solution met the problem, and the budget should show how much each element of the solution will cost and where the money will come from.

Remember to consider your audience when writing grant proposals. Most federal agencies recruit working faculty and researchers to review proposals; thus the readers are likely to be folks just like you, in a similar or related field. Therefore you need not explain every technical term you use, but you should provide enough information to allow the educated layperson to make a judgement. Foundations and corporations frequently use in-house staff who are well-educated, but perhaps not in your field. Assume that these readers are educated laypersons who need a little more background information.

And remember that the point of your grant proposal is to get the grant. Many faculty become used to writing journal articles, monographs, reviews, etc., where the point is to reach a true and defensible conclusion. With that sort of writing you must consider all points of view, balance your judgement, and temper your enthusiasm. In many of the sciences, you use the passive voice to imply objectivity and conceal the passion you (presumably) felt when generating your ideas. But in grant proposals, you should not consider other points of view, you need not balance your judgement, you should not temper your enthusiasm. Enthusiasm, even passion, get the reviewer's attention.

Except for proposals that will be reviewed by scientists, use the active voice. Don't conceal any relevant information, but don't include anything that is irrelevant to your argument just because it is the truth.

Ask them to mark every place in the narrative where they were puzzled and had to page backwards for information, or had to look ahead to see where you were headed. Those places need work. Your narrative should provide the reviewers with every piece of information they need as they read along, so they never have to look backward or forward. The Grants Office will be delighted to read your proposal, of course, but you should also ask a colleague who has not seen it before to review it for you.

Writing a budget on a spreadsheet makes life easier. When you change figures or add items (and you will--no budget is correct the first time it is written), the spreadsheet will recalculate percentages and totals automatically. We use the Tables feature in WordPerfect, since that's the word processor we use, but any spreadsheet will do. The Grants Office can write your budget for you, can help you set it up, or can review your figures.

If your budget includes salaries, you must include fringe benefits at the appropriate rate. Even if the position is less than half time, or you know that it will be filled by someone who will receive no benefits, you must budget fringes--it's a state rule. Current fringe benefit rates are available at http://www.uwsa.edu/fadmin/fringes.htm, or call the Grants Office (ext. 3195).

The indirect costs we receive are controlled by the Vice Chancellor. Deans receive 25% of the indirect costs a grant submitted from within a college brings to the university. The dean may use those funds to renovate some space for the operation of the grant, to stimulate further grant activity, to buy computer equipment, or any other expenditure allowable under state purchasing rules.

We must ask for the maximum amount of indirect costs the funding entity will pay--the Board of Regents has so decreed. We cannot request a lower rate in hopes that it will increase our chances of being funded unless the funding entity has announced, in writing, that it will not pay more that lower rate. Current indirect cost rates are available at http://www.uwsa.edu/fadmin/admcost.htm. Call the Grants Office to consult about indirect costs rates.

If your grant-funded project involves the use of human or animal subjects, you must obtain the permission of the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects or the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before you actually commence your work. With some granting agencies (the National Institutes of Health, for instance) you should obtain that permission before you submit the proposal. The Grants Office works closely with those committees; we can give you the appropriate forms and advise you on filling them out.

In order to submit an application for external funding, you must obtain an institutional signature from a responsible university administrator: the Vice Chancellor, the Chancellor, or the Assistant to the Chancellor. No one else can commit UW-RF to a grant proposal. In order to get that signature, you must fill out theApproval to Apply for External Funding form and the Financial Disclosure Statement for Grant-Funded Research.

These requirements are not bureaucratic roadblocks designed to make the lives of faculty and staff more difficult than they already are. Federal, system, and UW-RF policies require the financial disclosure information. Department chairs and deans want to know what is being applied for so that they can allocate resources appropriately; the Accounting Office wants to know that the correct rates were used for fringe benefits and indirect costs; the Grants Office wants to be able to brag about our applications and our successes; the Vice Chancellor wants to know what wonderful things the faculty is up to. No one wants these requirements to get in the way of applying for or winning a grant.

But filling out the forms and chasing down the signatures takes time. Remember that you must carry out these steps before the proposal leaves campus; therefore you must allow enough time before the deadline. In order to make this onerous process as easy as possible, the Grants Office will obtain the last three signatures on the approval form if you bring us a completed proposal, signed financial disclosure forms, and an approval form signed by the chair and the dean. Not only that, we'll make the required number of copies and we'll mail or ship the proposal by whatever means are necessary to get it there under the deadline--all at our expense. Please allow at least 24 hours for this process.

Our favorite way to help you with grant proposals is to work with you from the beginning of the process: generating an idea, searching for a funding source, serving as a sounding board while you develop your proposal, responding to and editing your narrative, writing the budget, and so on. When we are that involved, it is easy for us to help you clear the final hurdles. When we only hear about a proposal on the day it is due, it is more difficult to obtain signatures, make copies, etc. But we do the best we can.

Step 2.   Do you and/or your immediate family together receive from such a business $5,000 or more per year, of is the ownership interest you and your family have together in such a business 5% or more of the total ownership interest? If no, then the interest is not reportable.

Searching for funding sources is usually the first step in obtaining external funding for a programmatic or research idea. There are thousands of potential sources; searching for the right one is an art. We can search for you, if you like. Call, drop in, or write us a note listing your interests as completely as you can. Or you can use the resources listed below to search for funding sources yourself.

Other electronic resources--Most  federal agencies now have Web sites where they include grant announcements and application guidelines. You can search the Federal Register and the Commerce Business Daily, which advertises federal contracts and cooperative agreements. Many of the larger foundations and corporations make grant information available electronically as well.

Academic Staff Development Program at UWRF directly promotes the effectiveness of faculty and academic staff with respect to teaching, professional development, and research. This involves the provision of adequate funding and time to faculty and academic staff to pursue activities related to instructional and organizational development, community and societal service as well as basic and applied research endeavors. Such activities are intended to have a direct impact on the career satisfaction of faculty and academic staff and in turn, positively affect student learning.

Protection of human subjects in research projects. Research which involves human subjects must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects (IRB) before any data is collected to assure that the rights and welfare of the human subjects are protected and that appropriate methods of obtaining informed consent will be utilized. The IRB has written a manual, Policies and Procedures for Research Involving Humans Subjects, which describes the procedures researchers must follow to gain approval of the IRB for their research. Call the Grants Office (ext. 3195) for a copy of this manual.

Research and Scholarly Activity Day. Each Spring the Grants Office, the Graduate School, and the Chancellor sponsor an institution-wide event to celebrate the research and scholarly activities of UW-River Falls faculty, staff, and students. Participants prepare posters depicting their research or scholarly activity which are displayed in the afternoon. We also offer a luncheon honoring poster presenters and all who have submitted grant proposals in the preceding year. At the 1994-95 event, we displayed 80 posters.

Where research is being performed using animals, a research protocol form must be submitted to and approved by the committee at least one month before the research is to take place. If the research is to be part of an externally funded activity, the protocol must be approved before the grant is accepted by the university. For continuing research, a protocol must be submitted every year or whenever the practice is modified.

UW-River Falls animal care and handling facilities once per month to monitor these practices and verify that animals are being treated humanely. S/he will report her findings to the Animal Care Committee.

All faculty, staff and students, using animals in the classroom, laboratory or in the workplace, must be trained in the appropriate handling and care techniques to insure the humane treatment of the animal and the safety of both the animals and humans involved.

Most faculty and staff who routinely utilize animals are trained in these techniques and may only need to update themselves periodically on Animal Care regulations. However, these same faculty and staff are obligated to instruct new staff and students in the proper technique in proportion to their involvement with animals. Extensive involvement means extensive training - slight involvement, less extensive training. The lead person, staff or faculty, will provide a statement that training has occurred.

A self study and self testing program concerning the ethical and humane care of animals is available. All those individuals regularly involved in animal handling, care, experimentation, and demonstration are encouraged to complete this program prior to participation in work, demonstration, animal care or experimentation.

The test program is to be administrated by the lead faculty member for the unit or research project. Retesting will occur at three year intervals. The UW-RF Grants Office will provide the guides for the test.

The mission of the Department of Health and Human Performance is to prepare quality teachers, coaches, fitness and recreation leaders who will enrich and support the well-being of others; help all individuals live healthy, satisfying, and energetic lives; and cultivate a commitment to physical activity and healthy lifestyle choices.

The department is committed to promoting physical activity and healthy lifestyles throughout the lifespan, whether it be through providing opportunities for exceptional performance in athletics; for a holistic teaching approach in our physical education, health, dance, outdoor education and coaching curricula; for creative expression in dance theatre; or for recreational and leisure opportunities through activity courses and the life fitness program.

Our degree programs in the College of Education are accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education. The K-12 Physical Education degree program was the first Wisconsin program to pass the rigorous standards of the National Association of Sport and Physical Education.

At UW-River Falls you will have numerous opportunities to immerse yourself in real world situations. Dependent on you specific goals you may enjoy experiences within public schools, fitness centers, and athletic/sports teams.

Students are taught how to design curriculum and present projects using a variety of media and technology. Technology is infused into academic preparation through a variety of the department's course offerings. Interactive computer software is an integral part of our human anatomy and exercise physiology courses, and our Kinesiology course incorporates analysis of movement through the use of cinematography.

UW-River Falls is one of the 13 comprehensive universities in the prestigious University of Wisconsin System. With approximately 5,800 students, the campus is located in the scenic St. Croix River Valley of western Wisconsin, just minutes from St. Paul/Minneapolis and their unlimited business, cultural and educational services. The 226-acre campus includes more than 25 historic and contemporary buildings set among green lawns, tree-lined paths and park-like mall areas. Since the student-facutly ratio is 18:1, students enjoy small classes and individualized instruction.

Internal transfer students (students currently enrolled at UW-River Falls) seeking to change their major to Health and Human Performance must complete an internal transfer request form found outside the HHP main office, Karges 111. Priority will be given to students who apply by October 1st for spring term and March 1st for fall term.

Acceptance of internal and external transfers will be based upon GPA, number of credits, specific classes already completed, current enrollment patterns, freshman enrollment, graduation rates and other factors affecting the number of majors in Health and Human Performance.

Awarded to a UW-RF student with junior or senior status. The student must be majoring in secondary education, and have demonstrated an active interest in extra-curricular activities. If a recipient cannot be found an elementary education major may be chosen. Preference will be given to a student who has an interest in conservation.

A commitment to the pursuit of international and/or cross-cultural experiences, particularly involvement in International Travel, Study and/or Teaching Program experiences. Shown evidence of strong leadership and consensus-building skills. A commitment to creative problem-solving and artisitic endeavors.

Awarded to an HHP major with a minimum 3.2 GPA who has been admitted to Teacher Education and who has been actively involved in WAHPERD and other professional organizations and shows promise of success as a creative educational leader.

Health Services. Students are eligible for Student Health Services during the two academic terms, and the January and Summer terms, as long as they are registered for classes and have paid required fees. Students are eligible between consecutive terms as long as they are registered for the next term and have paid fees as required. While Student Health Services covers certain limited health services for students at the River Falls Medical Clinic and Pierce County Reproductive Health Services, while students are eligible (see above), Student Health Services is NOT health insurance.

To enhance students' health by collaboratively providing basic health services, access to information and resources, advocacy for campus health policies, and prevention focused programming so that students can successfully pursue their academic, personal, and professional endeavors.

Certain immunizations are necessary for students to be protected while at college. Students should check their immunization histories and update any needed vaccines. All students should carry their immunization records with them while at college since they may need to show proof of immunization. See below for more information about recommended vaccinations and how to obtain them if needed.

Meningococcal - (Conjugate preferred) ACHA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all first-year students living in residence halls get immunized against meningococcal disease and other college students under age 25 who wish to reduce their risk for the disease may choose to be vaccinated. One shot with booster > 8 years.

Vaccine (HPV) - Females 11 or 12 years old. All females age 13-26 years old who have not received the vaccine (three doses at 0, 2, and 6 months). All female college students 11 to 26 years old. No HPV or pap test screening is required prior to administering vaccine; however, routine cervical cancer screening should continue according to prior recommendations. Available at the River Falls Medical Clinic, but must in advance to schedule appointment. Not covered by Student Health services, so you will be respoonsible for the full cost of the vaccine.

ACHA and the CDC recommend that all first-year students living in residence halls get immunized against meningococcal disease and other college students under age 25 who wish to reduce their risk for the disease may choose to be vaccinated. One shot with booster > 8 years.

Hepatitis A is spread person to person and through contaminated food and water. Persons traveling to high risk areas may want to consider receiving this vaccine. You must receive the first dose at least one month before traveling. The second dose is given 6-12 months later.

The American College Health Association (ACHA) issued similar immunization recommendations for all first-year students living in residence halls. The ACIP and ACHA recommendations further state that other college students under 25 years of age may choose to receive meningococcal vaccination to reduce their risk for the disease.

ACHA and ACIP recommendations, coupled with the availability of a new vaccine that may provide longer duration of protection, will help increase rates of immunization against meningococcal disease and will give college health professionals the guidance needed to help protect college students against meningococcal disease.

A reformulated meningococcal vaccine (“conjugate”) is now available that has the potential to provide longer duration of protection against four of the five strains (or types) of bacteria that cause meningococcal disease – types A, C, Y, and W-135.

Meningococcal disease is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection that can lead to meningococcal meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, or meningococcal septicemia, an infection of the blood.

Adolescents and young adults account for nearly 30 percent of all cases of meningitis in the United States. In addition, approximately 100 to 125 cases of meningococcal disease occur on college campuses each year, and five to 15 students will die as a result. Evidence shows approximately 70 to 80 percent of cases in the college age group are caused by serogroup C, Y, or W-135, which are potentially vaccine-preventable.

Due to lifestyle factors, such as crowded living situations, bar patronage, active or passive smoking, irregular sleep patterns, and sharing of personal items, college students living in residence halls are more likely to acquire meningococcal disease than the general college population.

Meningococcal infection is contagious, and progresses very rapidly. It can easily be misdiagnosed as the flu, and, if not treated early, meningitis can lead to death or permanent disabilities. One in five of those who survive will suffer from long-term side effects, such as brain damage, hearing loss, seizures, or limb amputation.

Hepatitis B  is a serious and contagious viral infection that attacks the liver and may lead to acute disease, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. It is a major health problem in the United States infecting more than 1 million people.

You can get the infection through contact with blood or body fluids from an infected person. Hepatitis B is a hardy virus that can live for more than a week in dried blood or body fluids on clothes or other surfaces. Common ways of getting the disease include: a) through sexual contact (100 times more contagious than HIV spread sexually); b) through the eyes or mouth by exposure to blood or other body fluids; c) through the skin by way of cuts, scrapes, needle sticks or needle sharing; and, d) through contact between an infected mother and her newborn child during birth and early infancy.

Although there is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B, there are safe and effective vaccines available to help prevent infection. The vaccination series consists of three shots given over a 6 month period of time. The vaccine is 90% effective for adults and 95% effective for infants, children, and adolescents who complete the three-dose vaccination series.

If students are currently covered by health insurance, they should check with the carrier to see what arrangements need to be made so coverage continues while at college. All students should carry health insurance cards with them. Participation in the University of Wisconsin System Student Health Insurance Plan (see below) is required for international students.

Must enroll online (domestic students) or send in via regular mail (domestic students or international students enrolling in additional athletic coverage). Cannot enroll by faxing or calling. Coverage becomes effective on the later of: the Policy Effective Date (8/15/2006); the first day of the term for which the proper premium has been paid; or 12:01 a.m. following the date the proper premium is received by Student Assurance Services. All coverage expires on 8/14/07, or when payment is due and unpaid. It is your responsibility to make timely premium payments regardless of whether or not you receive a premium notice.

Keven Syverson, MPH, provides campus-wide prevention-focused programming on issues such as alcohol, tobacco, sexual health, etc. He also speaks to classes, residence hall groups, and student groups and organizations on health-related topics and serves on several campus and community health related committees, and oversees certain prevention grants . Keven can be reached by telephone (425-3293) or e-mail (keven.syverson@uwrf.edu) for questions or more information.

The notifying of instructors and arranging of make-up work in cases involving absence of students from class are the responsibility of the student. A student who is absent should notify instructors by phone, email, or in person of the absence as soon as possible. In serious situations where the student is incapacitated and temporarily unable to contact faculty, family members may contact the Dean of Students Office (715/425-3744) for assistance with these matters. This office then would provide notification (not verification) of the absence to the instructors involved. The Dean of Students Office does not provide excuses for absences from class. Arrangements for make-up work, make-up exams, or possible assignment adjustments are entirely the responsibility of the student. Medical excuses will not be written by staff or providers at the River Falls Medical Clinic nor by UWRF Student Health Services staff.

Just as the University does not routinely require that its employees provide a written “medical excuse” for absences due to illness, most instructors do not demand that students provide “medical excuses” for their absences that are due to illness or injury.

It is, and has been for many years, the policy of UWRF Student Health Services to not provide such “excuses.” Our reasons are several, including increased costs incurred by Student Health Services for unnecessary office visits, that most illnesses or injuries are effectively and appropriately managed by self-care and do not require an office visit, and that we are committed to protecting student privacy. Our policy resembles those of many other universities and is consistent with the recommendations of the American College Health Association. Also, our Dean for Student Development and Campus Diversity, Mr. Blake Fry, and our Provost and Vice Chancellor, Dr. Charles D. Hurt, support this policy.

This policy is respectful of students, promotes mature behavior in our campus community, and avoids inconvenience for students, instructors, and Student Health Services staff and River Falls Medical Clinic providers.

In serious situations where the student is incapacitated and temporarily unable to notify instructors of an absence due to illness or injury, the student’s family or Student Health Services may work with the Dean of Students Office to provide notification (not verification) of the absence to instructors for the student.

Mission: Students, faculty, and staff and community members who work collaboratively to identify and address health and wellness issues that affect UWRF students, faculty, and staff, in a broad, systematic manner, based on available data, information, and research. This would be accomplished through working Subcommittees focusing on specific issues.

Mission:  Students, faculty, and staff and community members who work to collaboratively assure education, resources, and services surrounding the issue of sexual assault on campus and in the community.

Presentation of a valid student I.D. is required. If students are covered by an insurance plan they must bring insurance cards or information.  Some insurances may be billed first before Student Health Services, so if students do not wish their insurance to be billed for certain services, they should notify clinic registration staff.

FROM CLASS. The notifying of instructors and arranging of make-up work in cases involving absence of students from class are the responsibility of the student. A student who is absent should notify instructors by phone, email, or in person of the absence as soon as possible. In serious situations where the student is incapacitated and temporarily unable to contact faculty, family members may contact the Dean for Student Development and Campus Diversity Office (715/425-3744) for assistance with these matters. This office then would provide notification (not verification) of the absence to the instructors involved.

Broomball Hunt arena Tuesday, January 23, 2007--Just because it is midnight does not mean that teams come out sluggish like they have been pulled out of bed.  The Prucanators and the Last Word proved that to us Tuesday night with a intense game that came down to a lone second half goal.  With the first half a deadlock John Richardson punched in the games only goal in the second half to seal the victory for the Pruchanators.   The pruchanators, currently unranked are making a strong push to get in to the top ten with their performance on Tuesday.  We will just have to wait and see if they can keep up the intensity.

Hunt Arena--On welcome back Wednesday for Men's broomball "Don't worry, We'll Score" really lived up to their names by blowing out their opponent 9-0. If good sportsmanship was part of the score it would have been much close. "Don't worry, We'll Score" led the way with 3 penalty's, and easily could have had more. Hopefully they will learn a bit about the meaning of intramurals. Never the less, they killed them! The hat-trick of the game belonged to Ben Austine. His counter-parts of the battle we Steve Labocda, Nick Aspen, and Steve Maciosek, who each had 2 goals, which equal 9! It wasn't until mid part of the first half before the goals started to drop like T.O's catching ability in pressure situations. But once they started to go, there was no stopping them, one right after another. If only there was ice cream at Men's Broomball, I would have had my fill. A little cake and ice cream on a Wednesday night never hurt anybody.

Overtime revealed nothing less than these two teams were a perfect match up.  The game resulted in a tie.  Will these two teams finally determine who is the more deserving team during the playoffs?  Only time will tell.

Regulation was followed by three sudden death overtimes that consisted of some outstanding play by each of the teams.  There were great saves by defenders as each of the teams made diving saves with the ball nearing their respective goals.  While there was two different shots that plucked the post and another that smacked the cross bar.  Forcing a three player shoot-out!  In the shoot-out each goalie came ready to play while both stopped the first shot of overtime.  Tiffany Turchany of Hwy 13 snapped the tie in the shoot out with a little flop shot just over the goaltenders head and eventually claimed to be the game deciding shot!  Hwy 13 claimed their spot in the Championship game to face the Cool Kids.

Tuesday November 28- The Pretty in Pink volleyball team, who is currently undefeated and leading the women's competitive league came close to losing last night.  The match when into three games with Team extreme winning the first, Pretty in Pink winning the second, and then Pretty in Pink sliding be with a 11-9 win.

They played down a girl and ended up pulling out the win.  Captain Dana Calzavara said, "It was really tough playing with five girls and I was doubtful for a minute but I knew we would pull it off, besides my team hates losing."  With the volleyball playoff next week, Pretty in Pink will capture the number one seed for the upcoming playoffs.

In broomball action, the Ice Ballaz won by default to a Frost Foxes forfeit, but the rest of the evening was anything except uncompetitive. The Broomin Beauties fought hard in an overtime win to defeat Sigma Alpha. Goals were scored by Michelle Lynch and Allison Hoffman for the Broomin Beauties and the lone goal for Sigma Alpha was scored by Teresa Hanson.

The Ninja Penguins of Doom have been a team to beat all season, but they fell to the ladies from Pretty in Pink by a score of 1-0. Elbows were flying and players were getting knocked down all night, but Pretty in Pink managed to score late in the second half by a Cassie Peterson goal.

Despite all the efforts the Misfits won with a score of 2-4.  The Prucha Punishers beat the Delaney Construction with a close score of 1-0.  All in all it was a great kick off for the playoffs, no injuries and lots of fun to be had by all.

The men's tournament was a little more challenging with two teams that battled to the very last shot of the game.  The Ballstars, led by former Falcon hoopers Marcus James, and Kenny Marton proved to be too much in the end for perennial intramural powerhouse Team Greeting Card.  Said James, "This tournament was really about just getting out and having fun.  Yeah it is nice to win it all and the competition is fun, but intramurals is all about having fun."

November 19 Hunt Arena - The nail biter started even before the game started with "Hell's Angles" entering the ice with just seconds to spare before a forfeit was declared. It was a hard fought battle that left "Hells Angles" tending to their wounds. "Women's Rugby" is showing off their battle scars after a 5 to 2 final score. Women's Rugby won the game being led by Kendra Knutson and Jaymie Stocks scoring early.

Monday, November 13, 2006- Tonight's match up pitted the Frosty Foxes against the undefeated Prucha Punishers. Both teams came out aggressive and hungry for the win but Punishers captain Talia Zavoral notched the first goal of the game early in the first half. That goal would stand as the game winner as the Punishers took down the Foxes 1-0 on Monday night. After the game I had a chance to talk with the team captain Talia Zavoral. When asked about how big the goal was for her team's momentum she said "It really helped because they were a very aggressive team."  The punishers were also playing aggressive on Monday night taking 3 second half penalties but killing them all off thanks to the spectacular goaltending by their tender Haana North who posted the shutout.

Monday, November 13, 2006- This particular night played host to a battle of a top dog and an up and coming team trying to find some answers.  The Third ranked Crabtree United have proven night in and night out that they have the skills and dedication to have a chance at an Intramural title.  United is a team of little flair but they get the job done nearly every night.

Volleyball action tonight was exciting with a top ranked team looking another loss in the eye.  The Renegades played Crabtree United close up in game one until about the 10-10 point when Crabtree United took off and outscored the Renegades 11-3 and quickly finishing the first of three games.  Game two was a battle!  The game was back and forth during its entirety with The Renegades claiming the game with a 21-18 finish.  In the third and deciding game #3 Crabtree United proved to be superior with an 11-5 victory giving our #3 team another slash to add to their "W" column.

Ninja Penguins of Doom, who are the second place team playing on Thursday nights.  The first half and going into the second half the game was tied zero-zero.  With eleven minutes left to go Casey Danielson scored, and the Ninja Penguins of Doom took the lead.  However, less than thirty seconds later Carrisa Williams scored to make it tied at one-one.  The game ended up going into over time and ended in a tie. Carrisa said, "We played really hard with only seven girls.  We kept in the game and didn't let up."

The Cool Kids, who are mostly comprised of our women's varsity soccer team, have been the broomball champs three years in a row now.  On Sunday night there unbeaten streak almost came to an end.  With five minutes left to go in the game the Cool Kids were down by one goal.  Then Amy Jensen stepped up and scored a goal to tie the game.  It was definitely a nail bitter and looking like it was going to go into overtime when they score the remaining goal of the game with two minutes left to win 3-2.  Who will be the team to be them?

On Thursday, November 2nd, the air outside Hunt Arena was brisk and chilly, but there was plenty of heat inside.  Women's broomball typically is a popular Intramural activity, but on this certain night, it was downright sensational.  The 10:30pm game featured the undefeated (3-0) Ice Ballaz vs. the tenacious Malarky team (1-2).  It didn't take long for the Ice Ballaz to turn up the heat and take control of the game.  Katie Bollig scored the game's only two scores within the first five minutes of the game to give the Ice Ballaz a comfortable lead.

They then turned to defense to hold off Malarky for an impressive 2-0 victory.  When asked what the secret of her success was, Katie Bollig responded with "I just pretend that I'm not on ice, so I forget and play as though I was on land. This helps me stay on my feet. I also try to yell encouraging words at my teammates at all times."  Katie's strategy must be working as the Ice Ballaz stayed undefeated and moved to 4-0.

On Tuesday, October 31st, Karges Gymnasium was turned into a Halloween costume party where the only trick or treating action that was seen was done on the Dodgeball court. Yes, it was time for the second annual Intramural Halloween Dodgeball tournament. This year saw ten teams battle for the chance to be crowned Intramural champs, but in the end, only one could stand tall. Team Greeting Card, a perennial Dodgeball powerhouse and defending Intramural "Team of the Year," won all six of their scheduled games on their way to the title. It wasn't easy because The Lady Bugs (who also won the costume contest with some extravagant wigs and tight pants) were up to the challenge. Team Greeting Card needed only four games in the best of five to send The Lady Bugs home. "We were never worried about losing," said Nick Hall, the captain of Team Greeting Card, "We have been here before and dominated. His teammate and roommate, Chuck Sowa, didn't share Hall's sentiment, "I was nervous as heck!  I felt like I was going to crumble under the pressure."  Kurran Sagan, UWRF Recreation Coordinator, who watched and ran the tournament, said "I felt like Team Greeting Card had a chance to win it all, but I didn't think they were the favorites. They proved me wrong and I congratulate them on an outstanding run in the tournament."After everyone had their fun on the Dodgeball court and the fanfare had ended, Team Greeting Card stood victorious one more time.

Any student who is practicing or playing with a Varsity or Junior Varsity team up to but not including, the second game of the season is eligible for Intramural competition. Anyone who plays the second game or practices beyond the second game becomes ineligible for Intramural competition in that sport or its associate sport for that school year.

Team captains who enlist members on their teams who are trying out for the Varsity or Junior Varsity teams must be aware that an individual may not participate in Intramural sports and be trying out for the corresponding Varsity or Junior Varsity team concurrently.

A team entered in Intramural competition may not have more than two (2) players on the team who have ever played, on the college level, the Varsity sport pertaining to the Intramural sport being played.

Any player who is responsible for playing under an assumed name, misrepresenting a score, tampering with score sheets and records, or being an ineligible player in that sport and not revealing such information shall be subject to penalty.

Recreational League - This league is composed of teams who wish to play at a lower level of intensity and skill.  These are teams who play just for fun.  NOTE- There may be fewer (if any) opportunities for playoff participation in the recreational league.  If you wish to compete in a competitive playoff environment, sign up for the competitive league.

The Intramural program will not change game times.  If a team cannot field a legal team for a scheduled game the team captain is responsible for adding players to the roster who can play.  Failure to field a legal team will result in a forfeit and may affect playoff eligibility (see playoffs).

In sports with co-rec divisions, teams must have an equal number of males and females on the field at one time or one more of either gender (example- 3 males and 2 females is a legal team if the minimum number of players needed is 5).

Safety and the development of sportsmanlike attitudes are two of the goals of the Intramural Program. An individual must be able to accept defeat without blaming others.  Our program is for individuals who play and live by the rules.  Failure to abide by these rules will result in ejection, probation, suspension, or expulsion from Intramural activities.  Anyone who receives unsportsmanlike conduct is required to meet with Intramural staff before they will be allowed to participate in Intramurals again.

Protests, including eligibility, must be made on the field of play immediately following the situation which caused the protest, and must again be confirmed with the officials at the end of the contest. Only team captains are eligible to file a protest. Protests must also then be made in writing and received by the Recreation Department within 24 hours.  A protest form can be received from the Intramural staff.  No protest will be considered which is concerned with judgment on the part of the official.

Participants in Intramural activities may not consume alcohol nor be in possession of it during any Intramural event. Intramural officials reserve the right to eject from a contest any participant who in the opinion of the referee is intoxicated to the point where he/she may hurt him/herself or others. Anyone who is ejected from a contest is placed on Intramural probation. A second offense may result in more severe disciplinary action being taken.  No lit tobacco will be allowed in the field of play.

To create an atmosphere in which social relationships and attitudes can be developed through Intramural participation by upholding high standards of sportsmanship, fair dealing with all individuals and groups, and providing opportunities for leadership and cooperation.

The committee serves in an advisory capacity for all aspects of the Intramural program and also as a liaison between the student body and the Intramural Staff.  Some of its responsibilities include formally gaining and synthesizing student input and feedback relative to the Intramural program, and reviewing protests made by participants.

Students complete two years of a foreign language of their choice (e.g. complete any two-year language at the UW-RF, testouts equivalent to two years, or complete two years at another accredited university and transfer the credits to the UW-RF).

"It's a great way to learn about the world and understand it. International studies fits well with my major and may be helpful in my future career. Employers are always looking for people with international experience."

"The minor makes all the concepts and terms that you hear in . . . world news mean something. . . . It helps you understand why governments and economies grow or fail, . . . I study language and culture . . . [as part of] the minor."

"I want to be informed about what is going on in the world and this was a good combination of philosophy, political science, and sociology. [The international studies minor] combines a lot of different areas and gives students a lot of choice in direction."

"This is a very good program that helps student get more involved in other countries. I'm interested in international study because of the interesting courses that are offered. I would like to improve my knowledge of the business, economics and development of other countries. I would like to be able to work abroad someday."

Internships at UWRF are work experiences designed, conducted and evaluated within an academic context. Students earn academic credit while working in a professional setting. Ongoing communication, feedback and evaluation among students, faculty and work supervisors ensure that educational and work goals are met.

To further develop students' application of classroom concepts and skills in a work situation. to provide students with accurate and constructive feedback about their professional competence and development. to expand students' understanding of career choices, expectations, and on-the-job practices. to assist students in developing a professional network.

To initiate the internship process for obtaining college credit for an internship, contact the relevant department internship coordinator. In almost all instances this contact person will be the internship coordinator in the student's major or minor department.

Some departments post internships for their students, while other departments require that a student find their own internship and present it to a department coordinator to determine the internship's creditworthiness.

Because internships are coordinated uniquely in each college at UWRF, all internship postings should be submitted through the UWRF Career Services office, who will in turn route those internships to the appropriate internship coordinators in those colleges for advertising to their students.

Employers work with UWRF Department Coordinators to ensure that internship requirements are fulfilled, and to outline the process and responsibilities that employers should abide while supervising an internship experience. Each department coordinator determines the credit-worthiness of an internship.

Federal EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity) legislation prohibits departments  from recommending to employers specific candidates for an internship position. All students must have equal access and opportunity to be considered for an internship position.

University Center ultimately endeavors to blend the natural beauty of the outdoor environment with student social space, providing an exciting and multi-functional area with a variety of student engagement opportunities.

The Cyber Cafe in University Center is a great place to do just that. No more having to put up with signs saying "no food or beverages allowed" here. Come in, be at home, check your email, check your Facebook, and enjoy a beverage at the same time.

Picture yourself walking into a two level room with a stage, dance floor and sound/lighting technology. There is a slightly edgy, energetic feeling in the air. The main floor standard seating is round tables of 6 for 144 people, or theater seating for 325. Walk up the stairs and past the game room and enjoy seating on the mezzanine level.

Then come relax by the fireplace! University Center has a number of spaces designed for lounging and meeting friends. If you want to stop by the Robert G. Sievert Fireplace Lounge, or just hang out in a cozy chair along the front porch, you will find ample areas to make yourself at home.

In addition to the eleven technology-enhanced meeting rooms, you could have many opportunities to attend events in the new ballroom. Special events serving up to 680 people can be accommodated. You also could attend a special guest speaker in the theater-style lecture hall, which seats 156 people. You can review the various meeting rooms in University Center and request a reservation.

South Fork of the Kinnickinnic river. A detention pond helps alleviate water pollution problems from the 65 stall parking lot located on the southeast of the building. A large natural seating area with a fire pit and patio are located on the southwest side of the building.

Information Technology Services (ITS) department provides IT support for the main campus while the Student Services IT group/FredNet group provides IT support for the Student Services administrative offices and the residence hall students. Beyond these two primary support areas, several administrative and academic departments have staff within their areas that provide exclusive support for their area. These include: Application Integration, Library Automation, Career Services, Facilities Management and Educational Technology.

The campus network is Ethernet based utilizing single-mode and multi-mode fiber optic cabling between all central campus buildings enabling LAN speeds of up to 1-Gigabit of bandwidth. All offices and classrooms have hard-wired network connections.

Residence hall rooms are all hard-wired with a “port per pillow” deployment in the nine double loaded corridor buildings. In the newly constructed South Fork Suites, there are approximately three ports per pillow when you combine the two ports per bedroom, one port in the living room, and one in the kitchen.

The network backbone equipment is primarily based upon Cisco switches with a Cisco 6509 Core. Internet connectivity is currently obtained via a membership to the WiscNet consortium through a connection capable of OC3 speeds. It is anticipated that the campus will also be required to connect to the in-process-of-being-developed BadgerNet Converged Network that is being constructed by the Wisconsin Department of Administration and SBC (primarily).

There are approximately 1100 desktop computers in use by employees and student employees. Seventy-five percent of these are Windows based and 25% are Macintosh based. All have high-speed network access.

The campus sports 40 computer labs containing 649 computers for general student use and classroom instruction. Additionally, we have 51 technology enhanced classrooms with computers, projects, network access, document cameras, etc. available to faculty for instructional purposes.

The division of Student Services & Programs encompasses the auxiliary services of student life programming, dining services, residential living, conference services, involvement center, student life facilities, budgets, contracts, day care, intramurals, field house and ice arena. There is also additional support of contractors such as the bookstore, food service operations, vending, laundry and the Kansas City Chiefs summer camp. The Information Technology department within Student Services & Programs is responsible for supporting all of the technology needs of these areas. This is accomplished with resources that are allocated to supporting the administration as well as the end customer who may be a student living on campus, a student living off campus, faculty or staff. The direction of this department is to have a tight control over the needs and services provided to the division; it is intently focused on empowering the division to do their jobs in the most effective manner at a reasonable cost to the operation. A majority of the funding for this IT operation comes from user fees and revenue generated within the dining, housing and student center operations.

The Student Services & Programs – Information Technology (SS&P-IT) department is split into two distinct areas and several blended areas. The FredNet Services sub-department supports the campus ResNet and the technological support of the administrative components of the division. The Information Systems sub-department supports the software development and maintenance needs of the division in all areas. Both areas are supervised by the Student Services & Programs Information Technology Manager.

ResNet) is based out of the basement of the East Hathorn Residence Hall and is primarily tasked to support the 2,450 students living on campus. FredNet Services provides 100 Mb Ethernet service to each student, television service offering 30 channels including a movie channel managed by the department, and telephone services. Students are also able to access the student file server for centralized storage, as well as access to the course directory structure that faculty may provide. FredNet Services also provides technical assistance with computers, telephones and television equipment that is owned by the student through an in-room support arrangement. Troubleshooting, virus disinfection and recovery services are all provided to the student living on campus at no additional charge above and beyond the room rate.

For those students that do not have their own computer, FredNet Services provides four to six computers and a printer in each Residence Hall. These computers provide the students with Internet access and access to Microsoft Word, Excel and Power Point. Students are also able to access the student file server for centralized storage, as well as access to the course directory structure that faculty may provide.

In addition to providing these services above and beyond the campus support structure, FredNet Services assists the students with campus wide applications as well. FredNet Services is the front line support for e-mail, web, student file storage and electronic online course learning through Desire2Learn. FredNet Services works with ITS on behalf of the student to resolve issues that need to be resolved by that department. The vast majority of the support to the on-campus students is done using student employees. The use of student employees is essential in accomplishing all of these tasks.

Due to the financial support of the Residential Living budget for FredNet’s operations, the value-added support that FredNet Services provides does not extend to those students living off campus. Students living off campus receive their support from Information Technology Services exclusively. When students move off campus, they continue to request services from FredNet Services; however, their requests must be declined.

In addition to supporting the students directly, FredNet Services supports approximately 400 student, paraprofessional, and professional staff members in the division. Desktop computer and telecommunications support is provided to each of these staff members. The core administrative support is the Student Center based staff, with additional support in 13 other buildings campus-wide.

The Information Systems (IS) group is engineered to directly support the software and web development needs of the department. They are responsible not only for developing in-house software to meet our needs, but are essential in integrating third-party applications that are necessary to support the needs of our customers.

Supermarket. Supermarket encompasses mostly Residential Living and Dining Services; however, it also encompasses bits and pieces of the division to integrate more seamlessly (such as the Card Office and door access).

The use of third-party applications is employed when a specific area of expertise is needed and the third party can do it better or less expensively. Currently this is used for our door access, campus card production and point of sale support, as well as in our Child Center management. The Information Systems group works with these various systems to maintain them and provide a high level of functionality and service to the student customers.

Student Services & Programs – Information Technology works closely with the ITS Network Services team to manage the campus network and server infrastructure. Student Services & Programs attempts to not duplicate services whenever possible by having a financial and working relationship that is very strong. This bond between the staff has benefited both ITS and SS&P-IT in reducing costs and helping to eliminate duplicated systems that may occur on other campuses without this working relationship.

Student Services & Programs – Information Technology funds a portion of the staff component in the ITS Electronic Repair team for the purpose of assisting in maintaining the telecommunications infrastructure in the SS&P buildings. SS&P-IT works with ITS Electronic Repair to have phone lines and equipment maintained, data communications cabling installed and other services through out the year. This partnership enables SS&P-IT to provide a higher level of service without duplicating staff that are already supporting this function on a campus wide basis.

IT manages the library’s open computer labs on the main floor and in the library instruction lab on the upper level of the library. IT manages the library Voyager servers that run the library system including public catalog and several staff modules. It also assists with managing the proxy server that allows off-campus access to the many library electronic resources.

In addition to the areas listed above, various other administrative and academic departments have special-purpose information systems that they have acquired or written to support their specific area.

UW-River Falls would like to conduct an on campus review/assessment of our current information technology (IT) environment. The consultants will be asked to evaluate the operations and structure of IT services and support and to make recommendations as to organizational and/or operational or strategic changes needed to improve our overall IT environment on campus.

Are the staffing and budgetary resources available to the ITS department at the appropriate levels to properly enable the department to fulfill its service mission to the University? If not, what levels would be appropriate in light of both our current service offering as well as any additional services we should be moving into?

There are a number of services that the ITS department does not currently offer and support. Of those, which new services would be of the most benefit to the University and what, if any, additional resources would be required to offer these services in a quality fashion?

Are there any existing services that the ITS department offers and supports that should be given serious consideration of being eliminated or outsourced so that our resources may be more strategically redirected?

The Consultants will review documentation and meet with key stakeholders (over a 3-day period) to provide a written analysis and opinion addressing the above issues. The Vice Chancellor would like this report within 30 days of the campus visit. This report will be addressed “confidentially” to the Chancellor and the Vice Chancellor for Administration & Finance. Portions of this report will then be shared with the campus community.

According to Badger Books, the book explores a unique high school football team. Through sports, Shorewood-Messmer partnership bridged two worlds, found success on and off the field.  During a normal football season, Shorewood High School and Messmer High School would be natural rivals on the football field. They're located just over a mile apart. One is public, the other private. One is suburban, the other urban. One is white, the other black.

In the fall of 2001, the two schools joined on the football field, with Shorewood hoping to boost a lagging program and Messmer looking for a return to the football field after nearly two decades without a team. In a compelling new book, author Greg Borowski was granted full access to the team, from the locker room to the bus to the sidelines, to follow the historic season.

The team was the first ever public-private football partnership in Wisconsin and, of a few dozen like it in the nation, the only one to combine central city kids with those from an affluent suburb. In Milwaukee, one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the country, the experiment took on an importance greater than that of high school sports. For one tumultuous fall, for the players especially, it meant everything.

The book follows the players, from two different worlds, on the field and off, as they learn about overcoming differences, working together and staring down adversity. It is more than a book about football. It's a story about race in a divided community. It's a story about growing up in a time of turmoil. It's a story about working together and getting along.

The front cover of Issue 8, the latest installment in Topic’s editorial escapades, promises the reader an interesting, self-aware, scary-but-playful romp exploring the topic of Sin. With white text against a surreal, nightmarish background—a dusky image of a blonde, her photograph riddled with bullet holes—the cover copy promises variety.

From Mormon homosexuality to Croat bigotry, from the confessions of a car salesman to the story of two incestuous Church-goers, this issue certainly doesn’t back away from its Topic. The journal is a little too glitzy, a little too shock-for-shock’s sake, a little too contrived, a little too . . . not-literary. I’m slipping my subscription card in the mail today.

Prize-winning novel: In the rural American south during the depths of the Depression, two children watch as their principled father takes a stand against intolerance. A gentle and leisurely movie despite some rough content, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' benefits immensely from its near-perfect casting, particularly of Mary Badham and Philip Alford as the children and Gregory Peck in the role for which he is best remembered, as their wise and patient father.

De Jong's intention from the beginning was to ensure that contemporary trends in American music would become part of the repertoire of River Falls music students. This project has continued at UW-River Falls for thirty-seven years.

Composers benefit too. They often have the opportunity to expand their repertoire and write for a different mix of instruments/voices. For many, the chance to work with students in an educational setting is an invigorating departure from their normal routine. Several came to campus early in their careers and have gone on to greater accomplishments. Henry Brant, who premiered a piece in 1975, recently won a Pulitzer prize.

Armed with his passport, ATM card, Eurail pass, back packs (large and small), lots of film, and great curiosity, Sean Vander Veen ('02) took off on a 30 day exploration of 17 cities in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Czech Republic in July and August, riding the rails, staying in youth hostels, eating from grocery stores, meeting interesting fellow travelers from around the world, attending concerts. He visited art museums, concentration camps, birthplaces as well as resting places of a number of composers, plus castles, and famous churches (where he saw fine old organs and even was given a chance to play in the Grossmunster in Zurich....(Sean was an organ student at River Falls).

There was time also for hiking in the Alps in Austria (in a group with a guide). Traveling in the summer heat was not the most pleasant, but the excitement of the experiences made it worthwhile. His several hundred pictures tell the story of a comprehensive trip.

For Sean, the highlight of his trip might have been his visit to Leipzig where JS Bach was kapellmeister some 300 years ago, and where he is buried. There is a large statue of Bach outside the church.

New students are to audition for admittance to pursue any degree in music. Letters of admittance will be sent two weeks after the final audition date.

The Office of Public Affairs news bureau serves about 500 media outlets each year both by initiating news releases as well as responding to media queries. We e-mail releases on Friday mornings and post them on News Source on Monday mornings.

Student honors, awards, achievements, scholarships, participation at conferences, presentations, etc. College staff, faculty and advisors are encouraged to provide basic information, including a brief description of the activity and a list of students' names, majors, class rank and hometowns.

Bureau routinely distributes feature or news/feature releases in these areas. Faculty and staff may either forward the information to the News Bureau or call to set up an appointment to further discuss story possibilities.

Proximity. This means geography. UW-RF has the most impact in River Falls because that's where it's located. A UW-RF student from Amery who is accomplished will be news in Amery. The larger the media outlet, the less likely that this will be the case.

For example, it was just as much news when Dan Brandenstein took his fourth shuttle flight as his first. Obviously, the more criteria you can satisfy, the greater the chances that a story will be published.

We maintain extensive distribution lists that are oriented toward general print, broadcast and online media as well as specialized media for agriculture, women's, people of color, events. etc. We have directories of all weekly and daily newspapers, radio stations and television outlets in the United States as well as specialty media in the Twin Cities, Madison and Milwaukee metropolitan areas.

This academic advisors have a thorough understanding of the current curriculum, institutional policies and procedures, requirements, course sequences and general education requirements. Your advisor will assist you in planning your classes for each semester and help you to determine an educational path that is right for you. He or she will also review your progress and, when needed, may refer you to appropriate support services. The staff is particularly aware of the needs of Pre-Major students and resources for them.

An advisee should consult their advisor before making changes in an approved schedule, academic plan, changing majors, transferring, or withdrawing from college. If you are having academic difficulties your advisor can refer you to resources that will help to correct them.

Seek help if you need it! There are a number of offices on campus that can help you academically. The Writing Lab, 290 KFA, can assist you improve writing skills and more polished written assignments. The Math Help Center, 145 North Hall, can help you with any math problems you may have. See Study Resource Room Hours for a list of additional walk in tutorial assistance. Your academic advisor is a good first stop when you need assistance.

Leave a wide margin on the left for writing probable test questions. Leave the left hand page blank. Later you will use the back of each preceding left hand page to integrate reading, lecture, and other notes while you are studying.

Skim through the book and read topical and subtopical headings and sentences. Read the summaries at the end of chapters and book. Try to anticipate what the author is going to say. Write these notes on paper, in sequence; then look over the jottings to get an over-all idea or picture.

Choosing a major is an integral part the college experience and a step towards a career path. For some people choosing a major is harder than for others and there is no simple formula for making your decision. This section of the PRE-MAJOR web site will give you a strategy and some tips on choosing a major.

Review the UW-RF catalog to familiarize yourself with majors offered, course requirements, general education requirements and prerequisites. When you register for classes try not to arbitrarily choose classes that meet general education requirements but that also pique your interest. You can also potentially take elective courses just to learn more about various majors.

Interview people who have jobs that are appealing to you or shadow them for a day. Meet with a variety of professors and ask questions about the majors in their department and what career opportunities these majors lead to. One of the most useful resources when investigating the possibilities is Career Services. Career Services offers a wide variety of resources in helping you choose a major such as self assessment and interest inventories, career counseling, internship postings, workshops, and much more.

The second step is to LIMIT the possibilities. Now that you have investigated your options, you need to limit them to two or three fields and then investigate them more in-depth. Match what you have learned about your personal interests with what you have learned about occupations. By the time you have completed this step you should be ready to choose a major.

Now you should CHOOSE a major. After you have chosen a major you will need to officially declare your major.Go to the department office that offers the major you wish to declare. You will need to fill out the required paperwork and then you will be assigned an advisor in that department. Your Pre-Major advisor will be notified and will forward your records to your new advisor. Make your major official before registering so that your DARS reflects the courses required in your major.

Don't wait until you are failing to get help or to ask questions. If you haven't been going to class, start. Talk to your professor. Ask him or her what you can do to bring your grade up? Visit the Academic Success Center and sign up for a tutor. Consult your advisor to see if it is worthwhile to drop the course. REMEMBER: You cannot simply drop a course late in the semester because you are failing. You need to be aware of your own skills and abilities and act sooner rather than later. Refer to Academic Success Tips.

Services located in the Academic Success Center provides reasonable accommodations to students with documented disabilities. Contact the Academic Success Center at 425-3531 and make an appointment with Mark Johnson. You can also contact Mark via email at mark.r.johnson@uwrf.edu.

GPA less than 2.000. they are readmitted after having left UW-RF while they were on probation or suspended for academic reasons. they have completed fewer than 30 credits and have a semester GPA of 1.000. To maintain enrollment, these students must meet with and establish an academic contract with their academic advisor or academic dean.

There are two criteria for satisfactory academic progress for the purposes of financial assistance, completion of 24 credits of course work in an academic year as a full time student and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. It is possible that, if you got a 2.0 next term, you would have enough credits but less than a 2.0 Cum GPA and loose your financial assistance. That loss can be appealed successfully under the right circumstances.

Go to the department office that offers the major you wish to declare. You will need to fill out the required paperwork and then you will be assigned an advisor in that department. Your Pre-Major advisor will be notified and will forward your records to your new advisor. Make your major official before registering so that your DARS reflects the courses required in your major.

One of the ways to succeed in getting a degree is persistence. It is much easier to persist when you have a specified goal. Having a major gives you a goal to work toward. Staying a Pre-Major for too long can also add years to your time in college. Many majors have specific general education requirements that you must meet and even though you've met the University requirements you must also meet the major requirements. Many upper-level classes in your major may also require prerequisites. The sooner you choose a major the sooner you can start making sure that every class you take moves you one step closer to graduation.

A "credit" is a unit of work in a subject equivalent to one hour of class a week throughout the semester. Thus a three-credit class meets for three class hours a week. There is some variance in this rule for laboratory and some other courses.

System (DARS) is used by the University to record your progress towards graduation. As a Pre-Major your DARS will list only general education requirements and signify what classes you still need to take and what classes/requirements have been completed. Once a major has been declared the DARS will list all classes required for your major. You can get a new DARS at any time. See http://www.uwrf.edu/registrar/darsreq.htm#student for information on how to do this.

Course registration is a very important element of your college career, so it is crucial that you understand the steps to successfully register for the classes that are right for you. Registration can be a daunting adventure so the sooner you master its intricacies the better.

Professional staff are available for one hour appointments to help you through the career assessment and exploration process. Meet with a career counselor at the beginning of this process to determine which personality, skills or interest assessments would benefit you most.

Apply for re-entry at the Registrar's Office (105 North Hall) at least 60 days prior to your desired entrance date. Any questions regarding accuracy of the academic records or policies regarding suspension may be referred to the Registrar's Office.

Contact the Dean's Office regarding setting up an interview. An interview will not be set up until you have applied for re-entry in the Registrar's Office and the Dean's Office has received your letter of appeal. The written letter of appeal must provide evidence of the ability to return to good academic standing. The most acceptable proof of academic preparedness for readmission will be fulfilled when a student completes no fewer than nine semester credits with a 2.500 grade point average at another institution.

If your appeal for re-instatement has been approved by your Academic Dean or Associate Dean, the Registrar's Office will send registration materials to you at the address indicated on the re-entry application. Any outstanding financial holds, transcript requirements or other obligations will be noted on your re-instatement letter. You will not be able to register until all holds have been removed.

Though the Department takes pride in the accomplishments of its continuing students, we understand that one of the best predictors of success in college is how well students do in their first semester.  Thus, the Department of Psychology does its best to welcome new students by providing a number of experiences to help them adjust to college life, and increase their chances to succeed academically.  First, all first-year psychology students are registered for a small, more personalized section of Psy 101:  General Psychology.  This special section is reserved exclusively for new students like you, interested in a psychology major.  Not only will your faculty advisor be the instructor for this class, but you will also get to know students with similar academic interests and concerns from the first day of class.  In addition, you will enroll with those same students in Psy 110:  Colloquium in Psychology, designed to orient you to our department, our faculty, and to career opportunities in psychology.

It's probably quite obvious by now that the Department of Psychology at UWRF is very proud of its students, faculty, program and facilities.  If possible, please take time to visit our campus during campus visit days.  One of the faculty would be happy to talk with you and show you around the department.

Thank you for expressing interest in finding out about the psychology program at the University of Wisconsin River Falls. Listed below are seven questions parents and guardians frequently ask concerning the psychology program at the University of Wisconsin - River Falls. We hope that the responses to these questions will aid in your consideration of UW-RF as the college of choice for your child.

A1: Whether measured in terms of popularity (# of majors), recognition of teaching excellence, caliber of current majors (numerous award winning majors), or number of students who go on to graduate school, the UW-RF Department of Psychology is recognized as one of the finest departments on campus. We are especially proud of the quality of our staff members whom are all committed to teaching at the undergraduate level, and who each represent a different area of psychology.

A2: Unlike many larger universities at which undergraduates would seldom have direct outside of class interactions with faculty, the psychology staff at UW-RF prides itself on its availability to students. Whether its advising (each student has their own faculty advisor they meet with at least once a semester), questions about class (all faculty post and maintain regular office hours), or social interactions (faculty members often take part in social activities like the annual picnic and bowling event), we will be there for your student! Click on PSYCHOLOGY SOCIETY to see a photo from our last student/staff event.

A4: The psychology department realizes that research experience is important both for students considering graduate school as well as those seeking employment directly after graduation. Another reason for the department's popularity is the opportunities it provides for students to advance their research expertise.

In addition to completing required courses in statistics and research methods, psychology majors have the chance to work closely with faculty members on independent research projects. Each years, our students present papers describing their research at undergraduate and national research conferences. Many of these projects are co-authored by faculty. Click STUDENT RESEARCH to learn more about student research opportunities at UW-RF.

A5: The psychology department realizes that applied experiences are also important both for students considering graduate school as well as those seeking employment directly after graduation. Psychology students at UW-RF have access to applied experience via our internship program which allows students to gain valuable experience in a work-place setting under the supervision of a trained professional.

A6: Most parents are aware that the most practical goal of a college education is employment. Knowledge for career opportunities in psychology, however, is a little less certain. Contrary to what most people think, the majority of psychology majors do not go into the fields of clinical or counseling psychology. The majority work in business, human services, and related fields. Others go on to earn specialized training at the graduate level. To get some idea of the kinds of careers undergraduate psychology majors pursue, click on Careers in Psychology Page a great site hosted by Dr. Marky Lloyd. You might also want to check out our alumni page to get a feel for the kinds of things UW-RF graduates do. Please click ALUMNI to read about some our recent graduates.

A7:  As psychologists we are very aware that college is a big step.  Department members also understand that one of the best predictors of success in college is how well students do in their first semester.  Thus, the UW-RF Psychology department has established several programs designed to help new students adjust to college life and increase their chances to succeed academically.  First, all first-year psychology students are registered for a small, more personalized section of Psy 101:  General Psychology.  This special section is reserved exclusively for new students interested in a psychology major.  In addition to offering students an opportunity to get to know students with similar academic interests and concerns from the first day of class, they also meet an instructor who will serve as their advisor for the first semester.  New majors also enroll with those same students in Psy 110:  Colloquium in Psychology, a course designed to orient students to our department, our faculty, our facilities, campus services, and career opportunities in psychology.  Another way new students are supported is through our Psychology Associates program.  In this program, junior and senior psychology majors are paired with new students to serve as mentors for them when they get to campus.  Once a student arrives on campus, their Psychology Associate can serve as a resource for you concerning academic, social, or any other issues for which you would feel more comfortable talking to another student, rather than a faculty member.

It's probably quite obvious by now that the Department of Psychology at UW-RF is very proud of its students, faculty, program and facilities.  If possible, please take time to visit our campus during campus visit days.  One of the faculty would be happy to talk with you and show you around the department.

Behavior Modification, Learning and Motivation, and Animal Behavior. Daniel maintains a conditioning laboratory that is equipped with a computer, a MED Associates interface, and several operant chambers. This lab is used in our learning and motivation course to acquaint students with technology that is essential for the investigation of basic psychological processes.  It is also used to provide students the opportunity to conduct independent research involving animals. In past years, many undergraduates have performed experiments under Dr. Linwick's supervision and several have gone on to present their findings at undergraduate research conferences.  Photos of the lab are available on Daniel's home page, which can be accessed by clicking here. Daniel's research interests focus on three areas: (1) the interaction of classical conditioning and instrumental learning, (2) representational processes in animals, and (3) incentive learning.  Dr. Linwick was named an Outstanding Faculty Member in the College of Arts and Sciences for 1999/2000.

As a division of University of Wisconsin-River Falls Information Services, the Publications Office provides services to all UW-River Falls departments, services and programs that wish to communicate through the printed piece or through the World Wide Web. There are no fees for creative services.

The Publications Office provides creative services and coordination to carry your project from consultation through delivery of the finished product. Services are offered only to those campus offices or organizations which are able to charge back through the University accounting system. It is our goal to provide consistent, quality publications that reflect the image of the University. All types of on- and off-campus publications are produced including brochures, books, booklets, cards, flyers, forms, posters and programs and world wide web page graphics.

Printed materials, photographs and visual presentations should take particular care to avoid sexism and discrimination through the use of language or depiction. The participation of women and minorities in university activities should be highlighted whenever possible, particularly in non-traditional roles. The Publications Office has available a publication regarding the use of non-discriminatory language.

The administrative responsibility for off-campus publications is in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance. The principle means of exercising control over these publications is delegated to the Publications Office. Other control points for prior review may be the various departments and offices of the University from which off campus publications originate or any of the Dean's offices. Every off-campus publication or format for a series of similar publications should be reviewed by the Publications Office prior to publication.

With the use of personal computers and desktop publishing, it is recommended that departments producing publications for off-campus audiences consult with the Publications Office to ensure publications standards and software compatibility. In addition, the Publications Office has a variety of helpful literature pertaining to desktop publishing and basic publications design that can be checked out.

These publications are subject to careful review by the Publications Office with the direct involvement of representatives of the department or office concerned. Each of the deans may wish to be involved in the review in order to provide the desired amount of standardization for publications of that college or administrative unit.

These publications should be reviewed by the Publications Office with the direct involvement of representatives of the academic department or office concerned. Once a format is established for similarly intentioned publications, further review is not necessary.

In the event that there is a disagreement over aspects of a publication that is not resolved through the regular review process (above), a solution should be sought through an ad hoc meeting of the department or office involved, the appropriate dean, the Publications Office and the Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance.

Chapters 16 and 35 of the Wisconsin State Statutes regulate state printing and the purchasing of state printing. The Publications Office is responsible for the procurement of all university printing paid by university funds. Failure to follow this channel may result in asking a person to pay for "unauthorized" printing from personal funds.

Printing that is "published by students of the University of Wisconsin System and which is funded solely from student fees or student organization income" is exempt from Chapter 35, although student organizations have the option to utilize the Publications Office and Fast Copy services with the permission of their advisers and the Student Activities Office and on a "time available" basis.

The University of Wisconsin-River Falls conscientiously follows all copyright restrictions. The copyright law (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specified in e law, universities can make copies of copyrighted materials for use in private study, scholarship, research and limited classroom distribution.

The following information was taken from a memo from UW-Madison's Office of Administrative Legal Services. The infringement which receives the most attention in the courts is the continued use of a copyrighted piece without ever securing permission to do so.

Under the copyright law, the copyright owner has the exclusive right to reproduce and distribute the work. Copyright begins in the act of composition and belongs to the author for life and to his/her heirs for 50 years thereafter. You, as an author, have your words protected whether published or unpublished.

The determination of fair use is made on a case-by-case basis. It is important to note that the law applies even to material distributed free to the students. It holds the course instructor responsible if the copying is done at his or her request, even if it is an outside copy center that reproduces and distributes the work. UW-River Falls' policy is that teaching staff are expected to secure permission from the copyright owners unless the intended use clearly is permissible under the "fair use" exception.

The American Library Association has developed model guidelines for classroom, research and library use of copyrighted materials. They provide a realistic approach to the University's need to disseminate meaningful and current information in its instructional program. These ALA guidelines are available in the Publications Office; they also contain a sample letter for requesting permission to copy and a summary of infringement remedies available to the copyright owner.

No automatic formula determines a fair use. However, you should be in compliance with the law if: 1. the materials are not used repeatedly; that is, you have not used them in preceding classes and you do not intend to use them in subsequent classes; 2. no more than one copy is made for each student; 3. the notice of copyright is included on each copy distributed; 4. the students are not assessed a fee beyond the actual cost of reproduction; and 5. in the case of longer materials and books, the portion copied is selective and sparing in comparison to the whole of the work.

The right to make multiple copies is weakened if there is any reason to believe that the copying will directly affect the potential market for the work or if it was done without permission when the decision to copy was made with sufficient lead time to request permission. This does not mean, however, that an instructor has free license to copy what he/she wishes if the decision is made the week before classes start.

The importance of planning for any kind of publication cannot be overemphasized. Preparation of a publication and printing is not a task that can be performed instantly. Many factors determine how long it will take for a publication to be produced including design requirements, number of copies, manuscript length and prior workload. Most small jobs can be prepared for the proofing stage within two weeks. Fast Copy strives for fast turn-around time; but again it depends on prior workload. Off-campus jobs usually require more production time. Generally off-campus printers are allowed a minimum of two to four weeks (10-20 working days) to do the actual printing. In order to guarantee production of a job within your time schedule, you should start the planning process early.

Consultation with our staff early in the planning stages can help you determine these factors. We will help you determine a feasible schedule, determine cost factors, advise you on manuscript preparation and discuss design possibilities.

The production schedules illustrated above are only guidelines. Each job is unique and will vary in procedure and time. For your benefit and ours it is recommended that you plan at least ten working days for pre-press production plus printing time.

An initial consultation with the Publications Office is necessary to determine what type of publication will work best for you. You should have an idea of some of the factors involved such as purpose, intended audience, budget, etc. At this stage, the Publications Office can determine production time allowances and plan where your publication can be most efficiently printed, either off-campus or in the Fast Copy Center.

Preparing your copy on either a PC or a Macintosh can speed up the typesetting process as it eliminates the need to retype the material. Copy may be sent on a disk (which will be returned) or by e-mail transmission. For information on preparing your manuscript or for software compatibility information, contact the Publications Office.

It is the goal of the Publications Office to provide editing services when necessary and when time allows. Contact the Publications Office for help in writing off-campus publications allowing additional time for this service.

If requested the art director will provide you with rough designs (pencil sketches or computer comps) of your publication to give you an idea of how the finished piece will look. Actual layout begins only after all elements of the publication are received and typesetting is completed.

The Publications Office has available books and manuals on basic design techniques for desktop publishing. Design consultation for desktop publishing is available to help you prepare an attractive publication. For those preparing off-campus publications using desktop publishing, check the University's Off-Campus Publications policy.

The Publications Office uses Macintosh OS including along with quality laser printing capable of outputting up to 12" x 18" . High visibility publications used for recruiting and/or for distribution off campus will be output at least 1200 dpi to maintain a professional image for the university. This high resolution will be achieved through the use of the university's contract printers or a service bureau. Publications to be printed on campus are output at 300 dpi for good reproduction. Printing your computer file directly to a high production printer is also possible. Check with the Publications Office for details and instructions in using this service.

After typesetting is complete, the job is sent to layout. The art director and design staff implement the design and assemble all elements including typesetting, photographs and art work. At this point corrections are time-consuming and may slow down the production process considerably; it is extremely important to have the copy prepared as accurately as possible when it is initially delivered.

This stage allows the designers to make the publication "camera ready"; that is, ready for actual printing, including indicating color separations, photo positioning, complex printer instructions, etc.

Before your publication is sent to press, you will be asked to proof the text and other elements. To ensure that all desired elements are in place, the proofing process offers you another chance to look over your publication before it is printed. At this point, any loose ends can be tied up--account to be charged, quantity, etc.

The client is responsible for detecting errors on the proof. The Publications Office is not responsible for errors if the client has failed to return proofs with indication of changes, has instructed us to proceed without submission of proofs, or if changes are communicated verbally. If more than one proof is furnished, corrections must be marked on all proofs. This is for your protection, as well as ours.

If your publication requires special paper, is a large run, large size or multipaged, printing is done under state contracts. For most jobs the Publications Office utilizes a local service contract printer and printing can be done within 8 to 10 working days. Other specialty publications or books are sent to various contractors in Wisconsin and require more printing time. Business cards are included in this category.

When a job cannot be done on campus and does not fall into the contract categories, it must be bid. Examples are those which are very complicated, have several pieces which must be color matched, process color (four-color or full color) books and labels or decals. Writing specifications for bid jobs and the bidding process will take an additional three weeks time (15 working days).

The regular purchase requisition is used for ordering all off campus printing. LDO's may not be used to purchase printing. You must include the quantity, description (title of job) and account information. Do not fill in the vendor information because of frequent contract changes. The requisition should be signed by the person responsible for the account. You will receive the pink copy after the printing order has been written and it will include the vendor, delivery date, order number and price.

After you have received the printed product, report any printer mistakes (i.e., wrong ink color) as soon as possible to the Publications Office. If the job is delivered late (more than one or two days late), contact the Publications Office immediately. If you receive the invoice or the artwork for the job, forward it to the Publications Office. Your jobs are stored there for future use. Auditing of invoices is done in the Publications Office and any problems with printing jobs are negotiated with the printer by the Publications Office. The Publications Office handles all contacts with the printer.

Jobs to be printed in Fast Copy require a Fast Copy order form, signed by the person ordering. At the proofing stage, Publications or Fast Copy personnel will assist you in choosing paper (available in Fast Copy) and other appropriate instructions to the Fast Copy Center (i.e., bindery, cutting, folding, etc.). Fast Copy charges will be billed to your account and are reflected in your monthly statement from the Accounting Office.

As it is the goal of the Fast Copy Center to produce printing in a rapid fashion, your printing will be done in two to five days depending on prior workload and complexity of the printing and binding operations. Completed jobs are to be picked up at the Fast Copy Center.

Copiers are provided in various departments on campus and are managed through the Publications Office. Most copiers are leased for a four-year period and are obtained from a state contract based on volume usage and department needs. The Publications Office makes all lease and maintenance payments, which includes all supplies except paper, and charges back the departments based on the number of copies made. Paper is also paid for by the Publications Office and ordered from Central Stores through an online form. Paper for the copier must be kept separate from other office use paper.

PDF files can be created from any original file by choosing Adobe Acrobat PDF as the printer and printing the file. If the poster size is large and you are unable to select a paper size that matches, use the letter size paper and print the poster to fit the paper (print to fit). We can print the small PDF file to fit the large paper size when we print to our wide format printer. If you need assistance, contact us at 3845.

Keep in mind that resolution settings must be high (150 minimum) for high quality output. Images taken off the Web at 72 and used in your poster will not produce high quality results. If using the UW-RF logo, contact Publications for a jpg file.

Files may be placed in your courses folder for our retrieval. Send an e-mail to fastcopy@uwrf.edu and include the file name and location, the paper type, the finished size of the poster, and the account to be charged (or other method of payment if appropriate). If your file size is less than 3MB and you are only sending one, you may attach it to the e-mail instead of placing it in your courses folder.

Welcome to the Survey Research Center Need economically priced information on land use, labor needs, consumer preferences, city services, main street development, school district referendums or other issues?

Center, located on the campus of the University of Wisconsin - River Falls, provides statistically sound, low cost information gathering services for towns, municipalities, cities, non-profit groups, school districts, and other organizations.

The center does telephone, mail-out and face-to-face surveys as well as other types of information gathering, such as focus groups. The Center works in conjunction with the University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension program and is staffed by University of Wisconsin - River Falls students. The center has a job opportunity for a Research Associate - click for details.

Staff work with clients to help identify topic areas for information gathering, clarify survey objectives and determine effective methods of designing the most productive and cost-effective method of collecting data.

The SRC helps clients determine the data collection method most effective for each survey. Options include telephone interviews, mail questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, focus groups, and others. The SRC can provide all the work associated with the preparation and mailing of the surveys.

Managing and Analyzing Data Using Excel and SPSS analytical software, staff extract the data and convert the results into percentages based on the number of completed surveys, or the number of people who completed an applicable survey question. Additional work requiring more advanced data analysis is available upon request.

After extracting the data, a survey summary document will be prepared which will consist of inserting percentages, or when applicable, raw number data into the applicable responses to each survey question.

All comments from open-ended questions will also be reported. If so desired, a written narrative report of the survey results would be prepared. This narrative could be a written report of the survey question by question, or an executive summary stating collectively what the survey results indicated. Depending on the distance to travel, there would be no fee for a formal presentation to the client/group requesting the survey.

The purpose of this survey was to gauge public opinion about outdoor recreational facilities and amenities offered by the County, to identify areas of potential expansion or contraction of these services, and determine funding preferences.

This includes tracking surveys in the multiple mailing procedure so that only non-respondents receive additional reminders. Mailing procedures are used to minimize both non-response and measurement errors.

Role of Moderator/Assistant Moderator and Discussion Format The moderator will present topics designed to elicit discussions about perspectives. Participants are encouraged to listen to and engage with one another, not simply to respond to the moderator. The role of the group moderator is to help the group maintain its focus and to make sure everyone has a chance to express their opinions/ideas. An assistant moderator, if available, will handle logistics at the meeting site, take notes, monitor equipment and watch for and record nonverbal cues among participants.

A typical focus group session lasts 1 hour. The session fee includes question preparation, the focus group session, transcription and summary of the collected data, and generation of a report. Please contact the SRC for further cost information.

State property, liability, and other associated insurances and claims are handled through Safety and Risk Management Office. All incidents should be reported promptly, so appropriate action can be taken and reports initiated in a timely manner.

The purpose of this paper is to set forth procedures for establishing a contractual relationship between the University and participating affiliates with respect to the responsibilities and liabilities of both parties.

Many departments, schools, and colleges require or encourage students to have clinical or field training as a part of the curriculum necessary to graduate. Such training experience is usually attained with the cooperation of an outside agency which agrees to participate in a cooperative effort with the particular school or college. It is in the interest of both parties that a formal agreement be in place prior to the acceptance of students into such programs. From a risk management perspective it is especially beneficial for the University department to negotiate a contractual agreement which clearly delineates the level of liability for the parties involved in a way that is consistent with our risk management objectives.

Directions: Complete all of the information requested on this electronic form and click submit below. The Office of Environmental Health, Risk Management & Safety will prepare the Certificate of Coverage using the information you provide. Please try to keep responses as brief as possible. If you experience difficulty using this form or have any questions, please call 425-3232.

In the Junior Seminars the Scholars focus on preparing a research plan and discussion topics include the scientific method, library and electronic research skills, and research methodologies appropriate to the various disciplines.

Throughout their first year participants work to conceptualize and plan a directed research project and in the seminar at the end of spring semester they will present their proposals for summer scholarly activity.

During the summer internship the scholars will receive a stipend for the internship and room and board, allowing them to work closely with their project supervisors (not necessarily their mentors) to implement the proposed research activity, having intensive contact with faculty in the laboratory or in the field and meeting weekly to review their progress and experiences.

For the Senior Scholars who have completed their research projects seminars provide an introduction to teaching techniques, ways of organizing presentations, attending and participating in professional conferences, the graduate school application process, and life as a graduate student. In their second year in the program students will present their project results publicly, either on campus or at a regional or national conferences. They will also identify and, where possible, visit appropriate graduate schools, prepare for and take the GRE, make successful applications to doctoral programs, and conclude the year with additional preparatory seminars.

This may include summer coursework at UW-RF or another institution, tutoring, or independent study. Faculty mentors and the McNair staff are also available to provide information, support, and recommendations.

The McNair staff is also available to Scholars for consultation and references to other sources of information. McNair staff and mentors are eager to assist scholars in choosing graduate schools and programs, to give feedback on personal statements or other elements of graduate school applications, and to help students evaluate their doctoral study options. Accordingly, the McNair coordinator maintains a library of graduate school catalogs and related information, admissions guidelines, brochures and announcements about conferences, and sources related to fellowships, assistantships, and other forms of financial assistance.

Throughout the two years scholars meet regularly with the McNair staff. At these meetings scholars are encouraged to discuss candidly their experience, including their work with their mentor and what they are learning, to ask questions, and to be open to considering ways to improve the overall quality of their time in the program.

The relationship between the scholar and the faculty mentor is central to the McNair program. After acceptance into the program, scholars are encouraged to meet with appropriate faculty members and to select one who is willing to serve as a  mentor and, wherever possible, as the summer research supervisor. The mentor may be the student's advisor or another faculty member in the major department; a faculty member may mentor no more than two program participants.

Mentors introduce scholars to the value of the academic life, the rigor required for scholarship, the joys of teaching, and the benefits associated with work as a professor. They provide an open learning environment and a dedicated example of an academic career and offer invaluable advice, guidance, and encouragement, specific for the scholar's needs and interests. Through the summer research internship and other opportunities that arise, the mentor involves the scholar in the process of conceptualizing and implementing research and presenting the results to the scholarly community. When possible, the mentor travels with the scholar to regional or national conferences, inaugurating the scholar in professional associations and introducing the scholar to key persons in the field of study. Throughout the two years the mentor cultivates the scholar's desire for learning and personal, academic achievement.

In addition to the skill-building aspects of the McNair Scholars Program, participants also benefit from personalized guidance in identifying suitable graduate programs and preparing successful applications. Mentors and the McNair staff are always available to provide advising on issues of choosing a graduate program, but the program also offers more formal assistance. Both the junior and senior McNair Seminars include discussion and exploration of topics directly related to graduate school application.

The first junior seminars begin with a basic discussion of graduate programs that lead to various kinds of academic careers and what those programs require in terms of time commitment, undergraduate preparation, original research, and writing. In this regard, mentors are an invaluable resource for Scholars, because of their familiarity with their fields and their colleagues at other institutions. Successive seminars address issues of building a strong application for graduate programs, including drafting a curriculum vitae and gaining appropriate research and teaching experiences. During the semester topical workshops provide practical information and advice about coordinating all the aspects of a graduate application and about preparing for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), which the senior scholars take in the fall.

Because most graduate schools and departmental programs have separate procedures and deadlines for financial aid, scholars receive guidance in identifying and applying for various forms of financial assistance, including teaching and research assistantships, fellowships, and grants. Many assistantships and fellowships are not awarded according to financial need, but, like graduate school admission, are also based on academic record, scholastic promise, and previous experience. In the senior seminars McNair Scholars plan for but also look beyond acceptance into programs and discuss strategies for building on their academic successes and retaining offers of financial assistance throughout their years as graduate students.

In the monthly seminars and workshops, as well as through the mentor relationship, McNair Scholars get the opportunity to learn about and to experiment with a variety of study strategies that help them not only to prepare for graduate study, but also benefit them during their time in the program.

Early seminars focus on library research skills, literature searches, computerized database and publication sources, statistical analysis, scientific method, and discipline-based research methodologies. Discussion and interactive-learning exercises may include time management, setting goals, identifying educational objectives, prioritizing responsibilities, and assessing resources and opportunities.

After the summer research internship seminars prepare scholars for academic careers by providing learning sessions on making presentations (including use of PowerPoint and logical arrangement of content) and on teaching (principles of adult learning, collaborative and active learning methods, supervising laboratory experiments, constructing lectures, and fostering classroom discussion).

Many of the skills introduced and practiced in seminars apply not only to later graduate study and faculty work, but also translate well into current undergraduate pursuits, in which the ability to organize coursework and analyze problems improves academic performance and enhances the educational experience.

Early in their junior year, scholars and their mentors identify possible research topics and begin to devise a project. Through their weekly meetings with their mentors and the monthly McNair seminars, junior scholars conceptualize their research in advance of the summer internship and begin to make arrangements for exploring a research problem that interests them. Mentors assist the scholars in assessing the feasibility of the project and guide them in writing their research plans and proposals that are submitted to the McNair staff prior to the beginning of the work and presented in their May seminar. This process equips participants with the skills they will need for their graduate thesis and/or dissertation.

During the summer, scholars complete their planned research project under faculty supervision and guidance. The internships are typically located in facilities on the UW-RF campus. In some cases scholars and their mentors arrange a research site off-campus, such as at another campus in the UW system, at a regional private facility (such as 3M or Cargill), or even at a joint-research project site at another university or funded laboratory (such as the Jackson Lab in Maine).

While working on the research project, scholars receive a stipend (includes room and board) and tuition for up to three credits earned toward their major. They often work 20-30 hours a week on their projects, with whatever degree of supervision they and their mentor deem necessary. The research/scholarly activity internship is the participants' main opportunity to explore in depth an intellectual problem of interest and to experience the kind of scholarly pursuit that makes an academic career so rewarding.

The research internship results in a paper of publishable quality. Faculty mentors assist the scholars in organizing their ideas, data, and summaries and in formulating papers for public presentation at the spring Senior seminars. Most scholars not only submit their papers for publication in disciplinary journals, but also present them at a state, regional, or national conferences, to which they travel with their mentors and/or McNair staff. This formal culmination of the research project enables scholars to experience the public defense of one's work that is required in graduate study and in the scholarly community and helps to initiate the Scholars into professional academic culture.

Through the senior McNair seminars and collaboration with their mentors, scholars also benefit from the opportunity to develop teaching skills. Seminars explore a variety of teaching methodologies that the scholars then try for themselves in a teaching practicum, arranged by their mentors. This may be leading discussion, preparing lectures to present new material, teaching a class based on the summer research project, or assisting in direction of a laboratory experiment. Exposure to various teaching theories gives scholars a better understanding of the richness of education and putting ideas into practice with a class provides experience that gives them an advantage over many other applicants for graduate teaching assistantships. As they prepare for life as professors, McNair Scholars gain a fuller appreciation of the joys of teaching, awareness of the ways in which teaching complements scholarly activity, and a more realistic view of an academic career as a whole.

The relationship between the Scholar and the faculty mentor is central to the McNair program. After acceptance into the program, Scholars are encouraged to meet with appropriate faculty members and to select one who is willing to serve as a  mentor and, wherever possible, as the summer research supervisor. The mentor may be the student's advisor or another faculty member in the major department; a faculty member may mentor no more than two program participants.

Mentors introduce Scholars to the value of the academic life, the rigor required for scholarship, the joys of teaching, and the benefits associated with work as a professor. They provide an open learning environment and a dedicated example of an academic career and offer invaluable advice, guidance, and encouragement, specific for the Scholar's needs and interests. Through the summer research internship and other opportunities that arise, the mentor involves the Scholar in the process of conceptualizing and implementing research and presenting the results to the scholarly community. When possible, the mentor travels with the Scholar to regional or national conferences, inaugurating the Scholar in professional associations and introducing the Scholar to key persons in the field of study. Throughout the two years the mentor cultivates the Scholar's desire for learning and personal, academic achievement.

Desire to pursue a Ph.D. in an academic area (Note: professional post-graduate education is excluded; for example, business, law, medicine, and engineering are not included unless students plan to become college professors).

Participants who begin the program at the start of their Junior year benefit from a full two years of monthly seminars on topics that build research and teaching skills, explain the graduate school process, and introduce professional academic culture (such as presenting and publishing research/scholarship). For two years the McNair Scholars also work directly with faculty mentors in their field who serve as role models, offer personalized advice, accompany the Scholars to conferences, and help them network.

In the summer prior to their Senior year Scholars undertake a summer internship in which they do original research or creative activity in their field, under faculty supervision, which prepares them for the kind of work they will do in graduate school.

During the summer internship Scholars receive a stipend, tuition for the academic credits earned from the internship, and assistance with room and board. There are also long-term financial advantages--see the next question.

Scholars and some actively recruit McNair Scholars and offer them graduate fellowships. Graduate schools know that McNair Scholars are motivated, have an understanding of the rigors and culture of graduate study, and have research and/or scholarship experience. Faculty mentors and McNair staff offer a wealth of information and advice about graduate programs and aid sources. In addition, McNair Scholars may sign onto the National McNair Scholar listserv from which they can learn about scholarships, fellowships, assistantships, special offers from graduate schools, and insider's tips from past Scholars who have entered doctoral programs.

Even if you are not a McNair Scholar, you may be eligible for fellowships, grants, assistantships, and other forms of funding. The important thing is to do as much research into financial aid possibilities as possible (see "Financing Graduate Study" in the Grad School Information section and "Related Links"). Do not be afraid of loans. With an advanced degree you will be qualified for higher starting salaries than if you only have a B. A. and loans can be an investment in a more secure financial future.

Whether it is better to enter graduate school or the workforce after graduating from college depends on your personality, goals, and circumstances. For some people it is best to proceed immediately into graduate school while they still have motivation for studying and before they acquire other responsibilities (family, career track, etc.) that may limit their options. Other people find that they need a break from studying, in order to gain work experience, or save money, or reach a clear decision about the type of advanced degree they really want. Some types of employment may encourage you to continue your education, while others may be less flexible and require too much time for you to study while working. If you choose to work after finishing your Bachelor's, decide how important graduate school is to you and make plans that will accommodate your educational goals.

Again, this depends on you and your needs. Full-time graduate study often provides a more supportive environment that can help you complete your degree and assistantships usually require full-time status. A part-to-full-time job apart from part-time studies can result in more distractions and lower productivity and satisfaction in both areas, or the two can complement each other, providing intellectual satisfaction, a steady income, and a balanced perspective. It really depends on who you are, where you work, and what and where you study.

The best way is to do a thorough self-assessment and to spend time trying to identify your goals, values, strengths, and interests. Career & Counseling Services can help you with this process through personality inventories, workshops, and individual career counseling. Your professors and the McNair staff are also a valuable resource, because they have successfully completed graduate school and know firsthand what it is like. In general, you will need to decide if you want to do full-time, focused study for several years, if you are honestly interested in doing sustained original research, if an advanced degree is necessary for attaining your career and personal goals, if there is sufficient financial assistance available in your field, if you are willing to move to a school that offers aid, and if you are willing to postpone the benefits of full-time employment.

People with advanced degrees have the credentials that make them eligible for upper-level and specialized positions, which have higher salaries to match increased responsibilities. Beyond mere economics, however, graduate school provides invaluable opportunities to pursue in-depth research in a field of interest, to study with specialists, and to improve methodological and writing skills. The rigor of graduate studies also offers a greater breadth of knowledge and enhanced critical thinking abilities that enrich your overall life. Lastly, graduate school is extremely challenging, which, like all challenges, serves as an opportunity for growth and for attaining your personal best.

Graduate studies require a long-term commitment. Depending on the choice of programs, field of study, and availability of funding, the general time frame for completing a doctorate is four to five years on a full time basis. Even with full financial assistance and the support of family and friends, it can seem like a long time to be living as a student. There can be times when graduate study demands all of your time and energy, which makes it difficult to lead a balanced, healthy life. It can also be insular, isolating you from outside activities, and in many institutions it can be extremely political. If you don't receive a good financial aid offer, it can also be expensive-graduate tuition and fees are higher than those for undergraduate study--although these costs can be offset by higher earnings.

As mentioned earlier, only you can weigh the advantages and disadvantages and decide what you are comfortable with and what is best for you. Be sure to take advantage of the resources available to help you make your decision-your professors, the McNair staff, email with current graduate students, Career & Counseling Services, and others with whom you can evaluate your needs.

Courses are taught by faculty from the participating universities. There are also courses offered by British adjunct faculty during the fall and spring semesters. All courses are designed to take advantage of the Scottish setting. Fall and spring semester students are required to enroll for a minimum of 12 credits. Summer participants are required to enroll for a minimum of 6 credits. During the semester program, there is the opportunity for independent study/directed study courses and/or internships with home campus approval. The semester program allows time for independent travel with a 10-day break and several long weekends. The summer program allows three days of travel/exploration most weekends. Many cultural activities are included in each program.

The Wisconsin in Scotland program takes you to Dalkeith, a bustling village just six short miles southeast of Edinburgh in the Midlothian region of Scotland. Edinburgh and the surrounding region provide an ideal environment for educational programs. The richness of British history, politics, literature, poetry, arts, and other subjects come alive at every turn. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland since 1124, is a classic European city. There the medieval grandeur of Old Town, crowned by Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Palace, joins harmoniously with the modern attractions of New Town. The natural beauty of the Scottish landscape and its coastline provide a majestic background for exploration, education, and enrichment.

The "Palace" is a magnificent example of late William & Mary architecture and is renowned for its fine oak paneling and carvings. The house is spacious and provides room for residence life and food service facilities, classrooms, offices, lounge areas, laundry and recreation rooms.

This program fee is for Wisconsin residents only. Out-of-state students are responsible for their additional tuition. Items not covered in base fees are passport fees, damage and work deposits, alien residence fees (academic year student), supplementary textbooks and supplies, special class fees, and/or other personal expenses.

"My experience in the Wisconsin in Scotland program is still the best experience of my life. It has greatly influenced me to be the person I am today. It has, above all else, taught me to be curious, tolerant and adventurous.

All positive traits that I have found useful in my everyday life, both personally and professionally. It has also given me life long friendships. I still keep in touch with many of my fellow students on a regular basis and the rest are in my thoughts often."

"The semester I spent in Scotland is one of the best experiences I've had in my life. It was a chance to step outside of my "regular" life and experience something completely different. Where else can you spend a weekend touring the ruins of an old castle and run into your Shakespeare professor?"

"For me, the WIS program was one of the biggest events of my life, giving me the opportunity to be carefree for four months, to explore the world firsthand and from another perspective, and the opportunity to travel like that which I probably never have again. For many of us, it was not only the early beginnings of our college years, but also that of our young lives. We were like shapeless, empty blocks of clay, waiting to be filled and molded with worldly experiences and culture. For many, it was the first time on an airplane, away from home, out of the country, or out of the state/Midwest. We left as little lambs on an uncertain journey, and came back as lions, ready to take on the challenges the world had had to offer."

"My experience in the WIS program was the beginning of an adventurous spirit that stays with me to this day. It was an opportunity to learn real independence from the standard home life and a way to gain lifelong friendships and memories."

"The most amazing part of the WIS experience was the feeling of complete independence and freedom it instilled in me. I never imagined traveling to so many unique and beautiful places until I arrived in Scotland. The Dalkeith local community embraced us as their own and I'll forever remember them and the wonderful people I met during my short stay in Scotland."

"I am reminded of the WIS program daily because of all the friends and the incredible experiences that we had. To this point of my life, the WIS program is the greatest time I have ever had. It will always be among the most rewarding adventures I could possibly ever embark on."

"My experience studying abroad in Scotland last semester changed my outlook on the world. Living in another culture opens ones' eyes to all the different people and customs around the world. I also took away so many wonderful friendships from this trip. I will forever cherish every moment I was able to spend in Scotland."

Delta Airlines will allow you to check two pieces of luggage weighing no more than 50 pounds each with linear dimensions (length + width + height) not to exceed 62 inches per piece. Significant additional charges will apply for luggage weighing more than 50 pounds or with a total linear dimension of more than 62 inches.

You can carry on one bag plus one personal item per passenger as long as it weighs less than 40 pounds (18 kg) with linear dimensions (length + width + height) that does not exceed 45 inches. It must fit in an overhead bin or underneath the seat in front of you. Following are some examples of personal items: male or female purse; briefcase; laptop computer (All laptop/computers must be carried aboard and cannot be checked.); camera case; items of a similar or smaller size to those listed above, such as Portable Electronic Devices.

The following additional items are okay to carry on and don't count towards your allowance: food items for immediate consumption; assistive devices such as wheelchairs or crutches, provided passenger is dependent on them; one box or bag of duty free merchandise; a coat or jacket; an umbrella; one item of reading material.

A:	You will need your passport and your letter to immigration officials from the Program Director. Your  letter to immigration officials will be included in  a packet of information which will be sent to your permanent address before your departure.  It is recommended that you make a copy of your passport and place the copy in a different location than where you have your original passport.  The copy will expedite the process if you should misplace your original and need to obtain another.

The official check-in time at Dalkeith House is between 10 a.m. and 12-noon on Thursday, February 1. If you arrive at Dalkeith House prior to students on the group flight, you can drop off your luggage, but you won't be able to check into your room until the bus arrives from the airport. If you arrive prior to February 1, you will need to make your own accommodation arrangements elsewhere.

A:	You are required to have a photograph on file with a copy of your application in the Program Director's office.  The other photographs will be sent  with your original application to the Resident Director in Scotland.  One will be retained with your original application at Dalkeith House, one will be posted, and the other will be used to obtain your bus pass.  You should bring at least two extra photographs with you for identification purposes and for the various discount cards offered to students.

A:	Yes, there is a combined damage and cooperative work deposit required in the amount of $100.  You should pay this deposit in the Office of International Education/Programs on the campus where you are enrolled in the WIS program before you leave for Scotland.  Any unused amount will be refunded when you return to the U.S.  The Resident Director will review the House rules with you.

A:	If you are eligible for work study at your home campus and have a work study allotment, you may be eligible to earn work study monies in Scotland. You can determine if you have a work study allotment through the Office of Financial Assistance on your campus. Please check with the Office of International Education/Programs on your home campus for specifics. All necessary paperwork must be in place before you leave for Scotland.

A:	Scheduling has been completed and most students received   their first choices.  (Note: If you did not receive one of your first choices and you need the class to graduate, please speak to the instructor upon your arrival at Dalkeith House.) Your class schedule will be included in the packet your will receive  before your departure. If you register for your classes at your home campus before your departure, it  is extremely important that you register for the same classes that you listed as first choices on the WIS Course Selection Form.

A:	There is a very limited number of books at Dalkeith House.  Library work can be done at Dalkeith Library and the Central Library of Edinburgh; both allow students to check books out.  The National Library allows books to be used on the premises only.  Please check with the Resident Director regarding what arrangements have been made to use The University of Edinburgh library.  Academic resources are also available on the Internet.

A:	Courses are expensive and inconvenient, because of the daily travel (the 6-mile bus ride can take 30 minutes or more).  Working out a schedule between classes at Dalkeith and Edinburgh is difficult, but it can be done.

A:	Pack light!  A large rucksack is practically indispensable for travel and it can be used as one piece of luggage.  Waterproof outer wear is essential.  Bring clothing that can be layered; Dalkeith House can be drafty at times.  Indoor swimming pools are in the area, so a swimsuit would be appropriate.  Bring some lightweight clothes, if you plan to visit Greece, Spain, etc.  Good walking shoes/boots are a priority, especially for females since they are harder to purchase there.

The atmosphere at Dalkeith House is quite relaxed.  There are occasional "dressy" affairs, but only one or two "dress" outfits are needed.  Females may want to bring one or two skirts/dresses or nice slacks and flats (some mix and match items), since the Scottish women dress up on weekends (more upscale casual).  Males may want to bring a jacket and a tie or two.

Hair dryers, curling irons, electric razors, and other U.S. appliances will not operate without plug adapters and (usually) voltage converters.   (Note:  Voltage converters rarely work well.)  We recommend renting hair dryers and  curling irons at Dalkeith House for a nominal fee or purchasing them in Scotland.  Clothes irons will be available for use at Dalkeith House.

Note: Students have experienced problems receiving packages from home that were shipped via UPS. There is a new policy that customs must require information from the individual if they have any suspicions. Packages that come through the postal service have been delivered with no problems.

A. High speed Internet allows for ready access to email and instant messaging as a main means of communication.  Dalkeith House has a computer lab equipped with personal computers and  Ethernet connections at four laptop stations. While high speed Internet allows users easy and efficient access to online resources, Wisconsin in Scotland policy forbids downloading, online gaming or transference of large amounts of data as it has an effect on the speed of Internet. Additionally, students are not able to add software applications or save documents to the hard drives on the lab computers. Student data is most easily saved on zip discs which students purchase on their own. High speed wireless Internet is also installed in one of the main common areas of the house, allowing all who choose to bring a laptop access to online resources. If student laptop computers are equipped with the appropriate conversion power cord, students will only need a British 230 volt adaptor attachment.

A:	As usual, this depends on your lifestyle!  Food is generally more costly than in the U.S. (some fast food places with lower prices and some fancier places with higher prices).  You can buy food at the local supermarket, or you can buy fast food at local shops.  You can also buy pub lunches or suppers.

You may wish to have credit and debit cards.  If your credit card doesn't work, you'll want another option.  MasterCard and VISA are widely accepted; American Express is not.  Credit purchases sometimes offer the best available rates of exchange.   Debit cards are highly recommended and you usually get the best rate with them.  Past students agree that the debit card is the easiest, fastest and best money saving form of receiving money in Britain.

Movies are more expensive in the United Kingdom.  Plays and concerts are generally less.  A play will cost four to twenty pounds although, with student concession, most plays are reasonably priced.  Most museums are free or have nominal rates for students.

A:	You should do some research.  Unless you have definite travel plans, former students recommend that you not purchase a rail pass before you go.  However, if you are interested in acquiring rail tickets, contact Carlson Wagonlit Suntime Travel, LLP as soon as possible.  Rail passes can still be issued before your departure and delivered to you at the airport with your airline ticket.  (Note: The Brit-Rail and Euro Rail passes cannot be purchased outside the U.S.)  However, if you are unsure of your rail needs, Carlson Wagonlit Suntime Travel, LLP can process the passes for you after your session begins  and mail them to you at Dalkeith House.  Campus Travel (a student travel agency in Edinburgh) has excellent travel deals for students.

A:	Because all students enrolled for the semester are required to live at and attend classes in Dalkeith House, a very significant and rewarding component of Wisconsin in Scotland is the host family program. Past students have found that an opportunity to get to know a local family enhances their understanding of the Scottish host culture. While each host family is unique and does different things with their students, participants do not live with the family but are often invited for meals, occasional outings to local points of interest or other family activities that allows interaction with individuals outside the program. Lifelong friendships between students and host families often develop. The host family program is only offered during the fall and spring semesters. If a  student has indicated on their "Admitted Student Information Form" that they want to participate in the host family program, every attempt will be made to assign one to them.

A:	If you intend to use the extensive youth hostel network (dorm like housing at very inexpensive rates) in the United Kingdom and Europe, wait and buy your card in Scotland.  They are less expensive there.  If you have a sheet sack, bring it.

A:	There is a computer lab equipped with software for word processing.  You should bring zip discs with you if you plan to save work. You cannot save any programs or documents on the hard drive. High speed  Internet and PowerPoint are available.

The estate on which Dalkeith House is located is pastoral living at its finest.  There are several nature trails, fishing, the adventure park and all sorts of animals:  sheep, cattle, horses, ponies, pigs, goats, pheasants, and fox, just to name a few.  There is also a full time ranger service.

A:	In spite of Scotland's often inclement weather, students have enjoyed camping in Scotland and in Europe.  Enthusiasts might consider bringing sleeping bags, cookers, or even a compact tent.  The program has purchased several tents that can be checked out.  Equipment can be rented at several locations in Edinburgh.

A: The best advice is to bring a debit card (preferably VISA) from an account that will be kept supplied with money. Several banks in Dalkeith do not charge an extra fee for extracting money from ATM's with a debit card and they give the best exchange rate. Past students agree that the debit card is the easiest, fastest and best money saving form of receiving money in Britain. If your debit card doesn't work, you'll want another option. MasterCard and VISA are widely accepted; American Express is not. Credit purchases sometimes offer the best available rates of exchange.

A: Students are advised to bring some funds in travelers checks (about $200) in case of an emergency or if your debit/credit cards are lost or stolen. Students often get charged a cashing fee and, with a low exchange rate, the amount received is substantially less than expected.

A:	All airports have an Exchange Bureau which is a convenient place to make a small exchange.    You can cash your international traveler's check free of charge at the American Express office in Edinburgh.

Gretchen Peters is associate professor of music at UW-Eau Claire with teaching responsibilities in music history and world music. She holds a Ph.D. in musicology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Peters' research interests are wide-ranging. She has authored numerous articles and is currently working on a book on music in medieval French cities. This area of research has brought her to France many times to work in the archives of France where she scours account books, notarial contracts, city statutes, and many other types of records from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. She has also pursued faculty-student research projects concerning the traditional music of the Hmong community in Eau Claire, as well as Native American powwows. She thoroughly enjoys teaching courses that study the role of music in a particular culture, whether it is nineteenth-century Vienna, contemporary popular culture, or the Native American powwow. She taught for a semester abroad in Denmark, during which time her son turned two, and she is looking forward to another teaching abroad experience in Scotland with her family, which includes her husband, a flute player, her son, who is now thirteen, and two ten-year old girls.

The Office of International Education/Programs will recruit and select students at each WCWC university. Applications will be selected based upon appropriate common criteria.  At the time of application submission, students must be in good academic standing and  have completed their freshman year before participating in the WIS program.

The following  forms are MS Word documents that you can complete on-screen. There will be shaded gray areas on each form where you can enter your information. Once you have completed each  form, save it on  your  computer for future use and in case you need to make any revisions   before submission.

After you have completed and saved these forms, you will need to print, sign and date them. These forms will go with the application you submit to the Office of International Programs/Education on your campus.

A required component of the application process is to complete a half-hour interview with a former WIS faculty or staff person. Your Study Abroad Coordinator will assist you with setting this up and/or provide you with a list of contacts on your campus. This interview will give you a unique opportunity to hear first-hand about the WIS experience  and it will give  us  an idea  about  your  potential for success in the program.

Before you schedule a meeting with your Academic Advisor,  you should complete  the Course Selection Form on-screen for the session you plan to  attend. To review a full list of class offerings, you can view the daily class schedule (.pdf) and course descriptions (.pdf).

The Office of International Education/Programs will notify you when  the WIS student orientation   will be held on your campus  before your departure.  It is very important that you attend this session.  It  will give you an opportunity to meet fellow WIS participants and  find out more specific information about the program (i.e., travel information, the schedule for your session,  what you need to bring with you, etc.).  Each of the campus contact sites has a collection of materials related to the WIS program and travel abroad that you should examine at your convenience.

Other things to stay on top of during this time are Financial Aid, if it applies to you, and applying for your passport if you do not already have one.  Also,  Wisconsin residents may be eligible for a  study abroad grant.

The Wisconsin in Scotland (WIS) program offers a limited number of unpaid internships  for students accepted for the fall or spring semesters.  There are a number of internship sites available. Internships can be obtained for a maximum of three credits.  Students will be required to carry additional credits to maintain their status as full time students. The internship program will be jointly administered by the Internship/Volunteer Site Coordinator in Scotland, the WIS Administrative Office at UW-River Falls, and the Office of International Education/Programs on the student's home campus.  Below are guidelines for students who wish to apply for an internship in Scotland.

Application Form, a general letter of application to potential employers, an official transcript, three copies of your resume, the Information Release Form, and the Faculty Mentor/Department Chair Approval Form.  When the application is complete, it will be forwarded along with payment of the application fee to the WIS Administrative Office at UW-River Falls.

If accepted by an employer, the student works with the Internship/Volunteer Site Coordinator to outline the job description, learning objectives and tasks to be completed to achieve each of these objectives. The  Internship/Volunteer Site Coordinator forwards this information to the faculty mentor.

At the end of the internship, the student will make sure the employer completes the Employer Evaluation Form and returns it to the Internship/Volunteer Site Coordinator who will forward it to the faculty mentor.

The faculty mentor will receive a campus grade report form and assign a final grade for the internship based on their evaluation of the student's learning objectives, progress reports, employer's evaluation, and the Internship/Volunteer Site Coordinator's comments.

The deadline for applications will be April 1 (14 months before the summer program begins). The intent of this amount of lead time is to give potential students information on courses to be offered so they can more easily participate in the program. Please complete the Faculty Application.

This selection process will be based primarily upon concerns for the development of a well rounded study abroad curriculum. The selection committee will decide which faculty members from the WCWC universities will receive the Scottish teaching assignment, and it will also decide which courses that person will teach.

The University of Wisconsin-River Falls is beginning the process of self-study and reflection that will lead to the development of an institutional report in preparation for a campus visit from HLC/NCA in the Spring of 2008.

This is an essential component for continued accreditation of the programs on campus. Although accreditation is a voluntary process, it is required for an institution to be qualified to participate in federal student financial aid programs. Accreditation also provides an indication of institutional quality that allows students to transfer and have their credits accepted by other universities and graduate programs. The Self-Study will require the participation of people from every part of the campus as we look carefully at what we have been doing to maintain quality and as we examine our plans for the future of the university.

However, it is essential that you begin to become familiar with the scope of this effort and help us to be sure that our self-study is as complete and accurate as possible. Use the submission form at the bottom of this page to submit questions, comments, corrections and additional information.

Please note that some portions of the text has been color coded to indicate those areas where we are aware that we need additional information. We'd ask that you pay particular attention to the sections highlighted and that you provide us examples and information in those areas where ever you have something to contribute.

Yellow— information that we believe exists, but the committee has yet to collect or process. This data will be requested by the planning committee coordinator prior to our meetings to prepare the second draft.

The organization’s allocation of resources and its processes for evaluation and planning demonstrate its capacity to fulfill its mission, improve the quality of its education, and respond to future challenges and opportunities.

Criterion FOUR: Acquisition, Discovery, and Application of Knowledge The organization promotes a life of learning for its faculty, administration, staff, and students by fostering and supporting inquiry, creativity, practice, and social responsibility in ways consistent with its mission.

Service-Learning is a pedagogy that integrates community-based   learning experiences with the academic curriculum to enhance student   learning and address community issues. This form of experiential   learning emphasizes analysis and reflection, and allows students to   meet their learning goals while engaged in projects identified by   community organizations in collaboration with faculty.

Service-Learning fosters the interaction of experiences with   disciplinary knowledge and theory-based scholarship. As an   instructional approach, Service-Learning enhances students' knowledge   of academic disciplines, expands understanding of self, and links   learning to the current and future civic roles students will assume in   a multicultural democracy.

This web site has several ways to assist faculty and staff to develop Service-Learning in the classroom. Explore and you'll find the resources you're looking for. If you have something you want to add, e-mail [Aaron].

As a faculty member, instructor, advisor, career counselor or student services staff person, you have an opportunity to influence the educational plans and out-of-classroom lives of the college students you interact with at the University. With this in mind, we have developed this section to give you some information to use when encouraging participation in service-learning and community involvement.

Below you can find research that has been conducted in the St. Croix Valley. These opportunities can provide with another perspective and provides answers. Notice, most of the text below has been copied and pasted from the source.

There is a consistent opinion that the top business  concerns due to city growth management issues are traffic congestion and  maintaining the community atmosphere. All three business populations (hill,  industrial parks, and downtown) listed crime rate/safety as one of their top  three business concerns.

People choose to live in Hudson because of its geographic location,  its community atmosphere, and to be near friends and family. Proximity to work,  the crime rate/safety of the city, Hudson’s  appearance and the quality of the school district are also key reasons for  living in the city.

Natural and cultural resources figure importantly in  citizen’s overall positive assessment of the quality of life in Hudson. It is not,  therefore, surprising that there is nearly consensus agreement that it is  important to protect Hudson’s  natural (groundwater, air quality, parks, etc.) and cultural resources (scenic  views, small town character, historical features).

The only types of housing for which a majority of  residents see additional need serve more specialized markets (affordable and  general senior housing, housing for the disabled, and general affordable  housing).

No single growth management issue dominates the  concerns of Hudson  residents. The concerns mentioned most frequently, by about one-third of all  respondents, are concerns about: maintaining the  community atmosphere, crime and safety, traffic congestion, and school  facilities and programs.

Residents overwhelmingly believe that the preservation  of natural resources is important. For all resources listed, the percentage of  respondents that agreed that preservation was important ranged from (82-93%).

When asked to indicate their preference for recreational  options in a future park, the only option was chosen by a majority of  respondents when combining their first, second, and third choices was a playground.

"Any    project in which the student must plan, design, implement, present, defend,    & evaluate themselves, and the value of their actions, in the context of    sustainable community development, as applied through their coursework..."

Sociology offers us a different way of thinking which better enables us to solve our dilemmas or difficulties or problems instead of watching them continue to get worse. It is a shift in thinking that is possible because the domain of sociology is the study of why people relate to one another as they do. It involves the study of our rules for living together. It studies how these rules are created, how they are organized, how they are perpetuated, how they are broken, how they change and the meaning we give to them. Because sociology offers us this special approach to the rules of social life, to the reasons for relating to each other as we do, it is indeed an "idea whose time has come" and very much worth studying.

First, we learn more about ourselves and our motivations. Second, it helps us learn how other people affect us, whether it is a parent, friend, spouse, child, or corporation. Third, it helps us understand our culture and how to cope with an often difficult society. Fourth, it helps us become multicultural and global in our understanding and our own relationships. Finally, it can help us learn how to get through each day successfully by developing a sociological imagination which allows us to see the forces affecting us, understand them, and get through them.

Since Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behavior, it is ideally suited to broaden one's liberal arts preparation thereby supplementing one's chosen career path.

Contribute to a complete education by improving the student's appreciation of the role of society in forming the individual. This involves understanding and unraveling the complexities of social life; learning methods appropriate for analyzing social reality; and being able to go beyond common sense to describe and explain classes of social behavior and the connections among them.

Educate the student for world citizenship. This requires an enlarged (broad) knowledge of culture and society and an appreciation of the meanings of human diversity. an improved tolerance of diversity and willingness to contribute to individual and community well-being are outputs of this process.

Provide education for a productive life. This involves the development of specific skills necessary for the pursuit of careers and professional opportunities, including graduate school. they include communication skills; team work and team building skills; critical thinking skills; problem solving skills; data gathering and analyzing skills; computer skills; as well as the following qualities; flexibility, adaptability and creativity; global awareness; and ethical behavior.

Educate for a love of learning by providing contact with faculty role models who will demonstrate that learning is a life-long process which sustains interest in community and society, and is consistently rewarding. This mission leads to the Department's goals and objectives.

Chancellor Don Betz has enjoyed a distinguished career in higher education for over 35 years. During that time he developed a reputation for teaching and encouraging students, leadership development and diplomacy through his international activities, most notably associated with the United Nations and its affiliated non-government organizations.

A frequent writer and speaker, Dr. Betz has addressed international, motivational and educational topics, and has worked with newspapers, radio and television. His life-long interest in global issues and his passion for promoting cross-cultural understanding led him to over 80 countries.

The completed mural will be three circles of canvas mandalas that will be a collage of individual squares. Participants will paint 5-inch-squares with either acrylic paint, permanent markers or paint markers. The themes can be reflected by individuals or by groups of painters.

The workshops will lead participants into the process of creating an individual painted mandala or circle on canvas board. To create these mandalas we will draw within a circle on the 5-inch-square canvas. We can fill the circle in spontaneously, letting the drawing emerge step by step in a creatively unpredictable way. Or, we can fill in the circle with special images that have come to us in reflection or planning.

Within the circle we can capture important scenes from everyday life, symbols, designs or objects of fascination from the world of nature. There will be prompts to help participants to think about the mural themes, but people are invited to bring resources and designs with them to incorporate into their piece. No experience, only interest, is necessary to be involved.

Mandala is Sanskrit for whole world or healing circle. It is a representation of the universe and everything in it. Circles suggest wholeness, self, unity, completion and eternity are expressed in many civilizations, including Ancient Rome and Greece, Gothic cathedrals, Tibetan Buddhist monk artistry, Native American medicinal practices, and the work of Carl Jung.

In this retelling of one of the greatest adventures of all times, Dr. T. H. Baughman, polar historian, will take the listener back to the Heroic Era of Antarctic exploration to learn about Sir Ernest Shackleton, a favorite of Antarcticans everywhere, and a model for leadership in times of great stress and danger.

Twenty-eight men stood on a desolate Antarctic ice floe one thousand miles from the nearest human contact. In a few months the ice would melt. To survive they would have to be safely on land before that happened—if they did not starve first. The odds were stacked against them. They faced all the horrors that the Antarctic could bring to bear: numbing cold and the worst weather on the globe. They could freeze, starve, or drown. They had a single advantage, however, one that proved to be decisive. They were led by Shackleton.

The whole endeavor provides a perfect stage to demonstrate the reasons why those who sailed with him regarded Shackleton as one of great leaders of his—or any—generation. Baughman brings to this retelling of the adventure the underpinnings of his work as a serious historian and his talents as a master story teller to provide an entertaining and illuminating presentation.

Dr. T. H. Baughman is a professor of history at the University of Central Oklahoma. His interest in the polar regions began when Ian M. Whillans, the noted glaciologist, invited Tim to join an expedition to Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica as the token humanist. That expedition also included Lonnie Thompson, now recognized around the world as one of the foremost scientists of climate studies.

Baughman has lectured widely on his research interests not only for their impact on polar history but also on how historical and polar figures demonstrate leadership lessons for the business world. He is a popular lecturer on expedition cruise ships to both polar regions and throughout Europe. His lecture venues this year include the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, the Explorers Club in New York City, and lecture series in the Black Sea, Baffin Island, and Antarctica.

DetailsThis is a writing intensive course. History and philosophy of vocational education as it relates to secondary and post-secondary programs in Wisconsin will be examined. In addition, time will be spent on how to develop, conduct, supervise and evaluate cooperative education programs at the secondary level.

All students planning to enroll in an initial professional education program in Wisconsin colleges or universities that leads to a license to teach in the state will be required to pass basic skills tests in reading, writing, and mathematics.

The tests cover basic skills needed by teachers and were selected by the state Superintendent of Public Instruction based on the recommendation of a committee of Wisconsin teachers and teacher educators. The successful completion of either the PPST will fulfill the Wisconsin requirement.

Undergraduate students are required to complete this requirement before student teaching. Students who took the test before 7/1/04 are not subject to a minimum passing score in the state  of Wisconsin. Students who take the test after 6/31/04 must  receive the minimum passing score to student teach.

Doyle told about 200 persons who attended the announcement, “UW-RF is obviously a natural to be selected for this pilot. This is a campus that has been devoted in so many different ways to conservation and to renewable energy.

He said the initiative’s intent is to have the campus produce as much energy as it consumes. By using innovative energy generation methods and buying “green” energy produced by local utilities without the use of fossil fuels, the campus is expected to break even on its energy costs in five years.

According to the Governor, his staff will work with UW-RF to develop an energy plan and then seek money from the Legislature as a front-end investment in technologies and research. He said the money will be recovered by cost savings.

The facility will be 40 percent more efficient than similar contemporary student centers. It includes a 48,000 gallon storage capacity of collected rain water that is used for grey flush water. The structure incorporates natural building materials, with a white roof to reflect sunlight, along with many other features. An educational kiosk will also be on display in the Great Hall, which will monitor various elements of the building’s resource consumption.

Creation of a Sustainability Committee that will work with the state agencies and public partners to investigate such steps as developing wind energy power plants on campus, pursuing solar generation, employing green roofs on buildings, reviewing purchasing processes for recycled goods, and investigating the most efficient methods to transport people and goods. UW-RF’s current strategic planning process has identified developing a sustainable campus as one of 10 goals.

The UW System is pleased to be a partner in this statewide energy initiative. Talk to faculty, staff, and students on almost any UW campus, and you’ll find that they are interested and enthusiastic about being a part of the generation that is making UW campuses more sustainable for the future.

The campuses selected to be pilot partners in this initiative are leaders in energy conservation and sustainability. I commend the campus leadership and all those in the communities of UW-Green Bay, UW-Oshkosh, UW-River Falls, and UW-Stevens Point for keeping sustainability as a university priority. Some of these campuses are pioneers in using “green power” – and others plan to do so in the very near future. I congratulate these campuses for their aggressive conservation efforts, and I commend their persistence in seeking out new renewable energy options.

Moving UW campuses closer to energy independence is another example of how the state’s public university is stepping up to do its part in the spirit of the Wisconsin Idea. Through partnerships among our universities, government, industry, and the private sector, we can move best practices and applied research from our campuses to communities across the state. We want to be sure all Wisconsin citizens can benefit from the innovative ideas our campuses are implementing toward solving our state’s energy challenges.

UW faculty and researchers are also devoting their own time toward bioenergy innovations. The UW System, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, and WiSys, the statewide organization that develops UW intellectual property, are connecting nearly 50 experts from a number of UW campuses who can collaborate on research and development opportunities in bioenergy and biofuels.

We want to advance research in this, and other fields, with state re-investment in the university’s budget. The Applied Research initiative in our budget proposal is just one way we can find solutions to some of the state’s – and the nation’s – most pressing energy problems.

We hope the state will prioritize investment in the UW in the next budget cycle for research like this, and to help the UW grow the number of baccalaureate degree holders in the state. More college graduates here and more research into the bioproducts of the future equal better jobs, a higher per capita income, and a more robust economy for all of us.

When the first Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference was created in 1978, Dr. Nelson took a leave of absence from her River Falls responsibilities to serve as its executive secretary and led the colleges and universities into the field of women's competitive sports. She was head of the physical education department from 1970-73 and was assistant to the vice chancellor for academic affairs after 1973. During her years on the faculty she coached women's basketball, track and softball and was adviser to the Women's Recreation Association and Delta Psi Kappa.

Furthermore, all students, employees and community members are welcome to set up an appointment to undergo the fitness assessments. Assessments can help emphasize the importance of having an active lifestyle to achieve and maintain high levels of cardiorespiratory function, ideal amounts of body fat, sufficient muscular strength and endurance and flexibility especially in the lower trunk and posterior thigh areas for a healthy back. It is a way to assess your present fitness level in a particular area and can be done on a pre-post basis to evaluate the effectiveness of a physical activity program. Fitness testing can be a means of motivating you to set short- and long-term goals; a motivator for improvement and a reinforcer for fitness maintenance! The Health-Related Fitness Assessment includes evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness (treadmill testing or step test), muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition (underwater weighing or skinfolds), with recommendations for the development and maintenance of each.

Benefit entitlement is 1 to 36 months depending on the number of monthly contributions. You have 10 years from your release from active duty to use VEAP benefits. If there is entitlement not used after the 10-year period, your portion remaining in the fund will be automatically refunded.

If you are on active duty, you must have your enrollment approved by your base Education Services Officer, and you must have your service verified by your Commanding Officer. If you wish to withdraw your contributions from VEAP, obtain and complete VA Form 24-5281 (application for refund of educational contributions) and send it to your nearest VA regional office.

Dependents' Educational Assistance provides education and training opportunities to eligible dependents of certain veterans. The program offers up to 45 months of education benefits. These benefits may be used for degree and certificate programs, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training. If you are a spouse, you may take a correspondence course. Remedial, deficiency, and refresher courses may be approved under certain circumstances.

If you are a son or daughter and wish to receive benefits for attending school or job training, you must be between the ages of 18 and 26. In certain instances, it is possible to begin before age 18 and to continue after age 26. Marriage is not a bar to this benefit. If you are in the Armed Forces, you may not receive this benefit while on active duty. To pursue training after military service, your discharge must not be under dishonorable conditions. VA can extend your period of eligibility by the number of months and days equal to the time spent on active duty. This extension cannot go beyond your 31st birthday.

The VA will mail an advance payment check, made out to you, to the school's cashier's office for delivery to you at registration. We can’t issue the check more than 30 days before classes start. If you receive an advance payment at registration, be sure the school certifies to VA that you received the check.

The tuition grant is based on 100% of the resident, undergraduate tuition charged by the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Students attending state technical schools or private colleges can also use the program. Additionally, the grant may be used at many out-of-state schools. The tuition reimbursed will be for a comparable portion of an academic year at the UW-Madison tuition rate or at the institution's tuition rate, whichever is less.

All Wisconsin National Guard enlisted members and warrant officers who do not possess a bachelor's degree are eligible to receive the Wisconsin National Guard Tuition Assistance Grant. College students currently enrolled in college, who enlist during a semester, may be eligible to have their tuition reimbursed for that semester.

The Veterans' Service Office understands this is a difficult time for you and we wish to make your withdrawal from UW-River Falls and the termination of your veterans education benefits as easy as possible. UW-River Falls will do everything it can to ensure students are treated fairly and do not suffer an academic set-back because they have been called to active duty.

All you have to do is bring a copy of your orders to the Registrar's Office and inform them that you have been called to active duty and whether you will take incompletes for your current courses or if you wish to have your tuition and fees refunded. Also inform them if you live in the dormitories.

Students will be given the opportunity to earn a grade or UW-River Falls will award a full refund of tuition and fees. No punitive grades will be assigned and the term in which the student withdraws from the university will not appear in the student's records. Students will also be given a refund for the unused portion of room and board contracts if they live in the dorms.

The Veterans' Service Office will stop payment of your veterans education benefits upon your withdrawal date, but will not require the student to pay back any benefits they received during the term. Your education benefits will be awarded until your withdrawal date.

The veterans representatives are students and will not be able to hold regular office hours, but many forms can be picked up and submitted in 321 North Hall without a representative present. Students receiving benefits at UW-River Falls for the first time must meet with a representative and fill out additional forms.

When the fourth Wisconsin Normal School was located in River Falls in 1874, the first building was simply the Normal School or at the dedication it was referred to as a "Temple of Learning." It was the most important building in a village of 1,200 that had no railroad until later and only board sidewalks down the main street. This "Temple of Learning" had been built at a cost of $51,351 and served those students preparing for teaching in the one-room rural schools. When the building was destroyed by fire Nov. 29, 1897, only a few things were saved. Helpers carried out the grand piano and a few statues (now preserved in the Archives), including one of Daniel Webster. When the walls caved in, President Parker climbed upon a wagon and shouted, "School will assemble in Thelander's Hall tomorrow at nine o'clock." He was answered with a cheer.

Though other cities in Wisconsin sought to "steal" the River Falls Normal, it was rebuilt at its present location on May 20, 1898. At the dedication of the new building there was a joyful gathering of townspeople, faculty and students, and a new president, Warren Judson Parker, was welcomed with speeches and musical events.

An addition was built in the early 1900s, but the name remained the Normal School until the new building across the street was added in 1914. Then the names of South Hall and North Hall came into existence. South Hall lost its steeple a few years later, but the first janitor, Frank Thayer, continued to sweep the floors, serve as "engineer," athletic coach, band master and "all-around factotum" for years afterward. More than that, he ran a museum in the engine room where a large brown eagle and two gray owls looked down upon visitors.

River Falls Normal School, there was joy on campus and in the community. This strengthened the belief that the Normal School in River Falls was here to stay, since the enrollment had grown making the classrooms crowded. At the cornerstone laying, June 12, 1914, a metal box containing photographs and greetings from former presidents and faculty was placed in the cornerstone. There were speeches giving credit for this achievement to President Crabtree and Regent F. W. Ramer, capped with musical presentations by the glee club and orchestra.

"prowled the west part of the old campus" -- the present mall between Hagestad Student Center and South Hall -- trying to select a site for the new building, "but it was decided that a block across from Cascade Avenue would be purchased ... the structure would face an open space to the west and was backed up by an alley [which is now Spring Street]."

Credit for the addition to North Hall was given to Senator Walter Hunt (who was also a faculty member) and Regent F. W. Ramer who had the "political savvy" sufficient to influence the governor and legislature to provide the funds for the new building.

The "Training School" wing that was added in 1927 completed the complex and that was observed with a great celebration on May 17, 1928. Having just been authorized to offer a four-year course for teachers and with a name change to "State Teachers College" North Hall symbolized its new role in Wisconsin as a degree-granting institution. A former teacher in the Normal for 10 years wrote on this occasion, "Long may it prove a Beacon Light for Mariners/on the Seas of Thought."

The agricultural and allied sciences were housed in several campus buildings over the years, but found a home in the new $2,000,000 building. The four-story structure included facilities for the sciences that had heretofore been located in North Hall and in the Ag Engineering and Industrial Arts building and a wing of May Hall where food science ovens were housed.

The original building which provided 20 laboratories along with classrooms and office space has had several additions from time to time. The first one added was to the west to accommodate courses taught on construction materials, machine tools and general metals. The first greenhouse was added two years later and in 1979 additional laboratories for welding, electricity and other fields were added. Later a food science wing was constructed for the classes in the processing of various food products.

The cluster of buildings housing the agricultural and allied sciences are known collectively as the Agricultural Science Building and provides instructional space for a staff of approximately 50, offering 16 majors and support courses for other departments. Indeed, as Keith Kolpack wrote in his Master's thesis on the History of the College of Agriculture (1979), the agriculture program at River Falls has "gone far" since its inception in 1912.

It was Regent P. W. Ramer who is credited with getting the legislature to buy the "Blood Tract" of 14 acres back in 1913. Located on the west end of the campus it was added to from time to time until there was a farm of 100 acres when Professor A. N. Johnson became the first farm manager in 1919. Later the adjacent Pederson farm was added, while the "old Ramer field" was used for residence halls and Rodli Commons. The 293 acre farm in Mann Valley west of River Falls was added after the new complex of agricultural science buildings was completed, providing two separate farms with a total of 440 acres for instructional purpose and research.

Falls, partly because of the curricula in Agriculture and in secondary education, but also because of the preprofessional programs in medicine, veterinary science and other fields. The departments in biology, chemistry and other sciences have been located in North Hall and other quarters from time to time, but not until 1977 did the sciences have a new home when they moved into the Physical Science Building. The $3.9 million building became the new home of chemistry, physics and psychology. The sciences then had classrooms, study and lounge areas, and laboratories with adequate equipment to continue the teaching fields.

"a milestone for the sciences at UW-River Falls which have always been strong areas of study here." On this occasion the 22nd Symposium in Chemistry for undergraduates was held and over the years Centennial Science Hall has been the scene of many conferences in the sciences, various instructional programs and programs in the observatory where telescopes bring to both students and the public the world "out there."

Department of Psychology, he said he could look back on a good career teaching students and stimulating some of them to pursue careers in psychology. As chairman of the psychology department he had seen the staff increased from three to nine, offering an increased number of courses for the growth in enrollment.

World War II and took Master's and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Minnesota. His chief interest in psychology was in abnormal psychology. Following his retirement he returned to the campus to offer some courses and after the dedication of the Centennial Science Hall, the Ed Selden Lounge was named in his honor.

University of Wisconsin - River Falls) in 1946, there was a lighthearted dinner given for him by the faculty at the White Pine Inn, Bayport, Minn. The program was a mock commencement with a salutatory address, class history, class will, commencement address and a valedictory address given by the retiring president himself. The ceremony ended with the presentation of an award for having been chosen as the "graduate most likely to succeed."

J. H. Ames was of New England lumberjack stock whose parents had followed the logging industry west and settled in central Wisconsin. He attended a one-room rural school and later was graduated from the Normal School at Stevens Point, after which he taught at a rural school, served as principal at several Wisconsin schools and joined the Normal School faculty at River Falls in 1909. His academic interest always centered on history and he was a follower of Frederic Jackson Turner who taught pioneer history at UW-Madison. In his later years he (with his brother) wrote several history texts for use in the elementary schools.

President in 1917, he sought more buildings than North Hall and South Hall, and more faculty holding advanced degrees. He had no interest in building a large school with large enrollment, but sought to move the institution up the ladder of quality teaching and accreditment by the North Central Association of Schools. He was happy to report in 1925 that this accreditment had come since the school placed emphasis on academic work and the departments were balanced and staffed for granting the B.Ed. degree.

It is no accident that President Ames had the complete confidence of the governing board in those years when the college was being built. His long experience in teaching and administration, his great interest in one field of learning in particular and of learning in general, his creative drive that had caused him to become the co-author of four American history texts and one volume on education in Wisconsin; these factors explain much about how the solid basis upon which he had slowly built here had been recognized by the governing regents. Faculty and students who have lived and worked with him will always remember that his counsel was good and his attitudes not subject to whim or fancy. The college is in a large sense the result not only of historic forces that affected all institutions of higher learning in this period but also the result of wise stewardship for over a quarter of a century. It is fitting that the new campus school opened in 1962, now the Teacher Education Center, be named in his honor.

At the time of his appointment as President, the Board of Regents had given some consideration to closing the Normal since the student body was down to 319, although the need for teachers was increasing as the population grew. It was the challenge of increasing the teacher supply that caused him to leave Nebraska where he had held leadership positions in public education.

Crabtree was born on a farm in Ohio, April 18, 1864. There he came under the influence of a great teacher who encouraged him to continue his education beyond the little rural school. When his family moved to Nebraska where land was cheap or free and educational opportunities were limited, they lived in a sod house. Somehow he managed to go to the Peru Normal where he worked for his board and room until he was licensed to teach in the common schools. Soon he became a village principal of schools, then the inspector of schools for Nebraska and from 1904 to 1910 he was President of the Peru Normal where he had once been a student.

As a Normal School President, he brought the best teachers and students there to serve the teaching profession. Many of them soon occupied teaching positions in the schools of the nation beyond Nebraska. It was Crabtree's reputation for having made teaching a more important role in life that caused the Board of Regents to offer him the River Falls presidency in 1911.

When he arrived in River Falls, he told all who would listen that "We are teaching children to do the work of the house as well as to solve problems of arithmetic and algebra." The community welcomed him with a special program. The train brought the Hudson band and baseball team down to join the parade on Main Street, followed by welcoming speeches, a picnic and the ball game (which Hudson won 9 to 5). The mayor called the day a "big and delightful success."

Although he lived simply, asking only the opportunity to serve, he recruited students by helping them get jobs to earn board and room, added professors who related learning with the improvement of home and community, and helped get appropriations through the legislature for building North Hall. A later President, J. H. Ames, said that  Crabtree "will always be remembered at River Falls for his remarkable capacity for meeting students personally and for making them feel his own interest in their welfare."

Education Association with headquarters in Washington, D.C. When he retired from that position in 1935 it had become the largest professional organization of teachers in the world and River Falls Normal that he had once led had become a State Teachers College offering a Bachelor's degree. It was fitting that a residence hall carry his name.

If Judge Jay Grimm, who served on the Board of Regents of the State Teachers Colleges, had been alive in the fall of 1966, he would have rejoiced to witness the construction on the former Ramer Field and the emergence of a residence hall that was named in his honor. Over the years he had always invited a few faculty to his home to observe New Year's Day. As they drank egg-nog and sang "Was ist das, eine Schnitzelbank?" from a guide on the wall and "Auld Lang Syne," they talked of the long history of the local college. He had served on the Board of Regents for 13 years and had labored long and hard in seeking appropriations for new campus buildings and for increasing the programs offered.

Attorney Grimm, born in 1878, had attended the common schools and having no college to attend in Northwestern Wisconsin, had "read law" with a River Falls attorney and then joined that law firm. Later, he founded an insurance company that dealt largely with mutual companies serving local governments in Wisconsin. Despite his busy schedule he enjoyed duck hunting, but was a "gentleman hunter," meaning he didn't go out at 4:30 in the morning. In 1941 he became Pierce County Judge and served until his death in 1955.

In the years when he was deeply involved in the insurance business in Wisconsin and serving as a judge, he had a reputation throughout the state and served on numerous committees, statewide as well as in this part of Wisconsin. As a regent seeking appropriations for residence halls and academic buildings for the River Falls campus, he was widely known to "carry a lot of water" among legislators. He knew the need of residence halls since he had two children go to college at River Falls who often brought their friends home with them. He knew that students of the region needed additional living quarters and academic programs. That is why he would have sung loudly on New Year's Day in 1967 if he had been alive for he could have pointed with pride to the dormitory named in his honor and to other strengthening of the State College at River Falls.

A scholarship to perpetuate the memory of Regent Grimm's contribution to this University has been established by his family and friends, to be awarded to a pre-law student. However, Grimm Residence Hall stands as a monument to his dedication that will always serve the hundreds of students who attend the UW-River Falls.

After the war he returned to River Falls and resumed his practice. With a partner, he was responsible for the design of countless municipal buildings and projects, power developments and other engineering services throughout northwestern Wisconsin. He was city engineer in River Falls for many years and a consulting engineer for the cities of Amery, Hudson and Ellsworth. He served as mayor of River Falls from 1940-43 and from 1950-52.

In 1953 he was appointed to the Board of Regents by Gov. Walter Kohler and he enjoyed his many associations in that role and the opportunity to serve the State College System. It was while he was a regent that the Student Union was constructed and he used his engineering skills to suggest economies that made the funding for the building go considerably further than was originally foreseen. He served on the Board's business committee and was active in the rapid building program of the State System.

He was a member of the River Falls Volunteer Fire Department, of the American Legion and of the 40 et 8. He also was active in professional societies and had served as president of the Northwest Chapter of the Society of Professional Engineers, as the Society's state legislative chairman and on its state board of directors.

He was still serving on the Board of Regents at the time of his death, Jan. 28, 1959. He died suddenly of a heart attack while talking with workmen at the new post office (now the city building) at Elm and Second streets.

Therefore, Be It Resolved, That the Board and the Council of Presidents join his many friends on the college faculty and in the community in this expression of deep regret at the loss of Mr. Hagestad's services in higher education and to the city of River Falls. The Board further regrets the loss of the wise counsel and good fellowship of this highly esteemed member and expresses its sincere sorrow and sympathy to Mrs. Hagestad and other members of the family.

Prucha Hall and majored in math and physics. His college roommate said he "was a perfectionist in everything he did." He was shy, but popular on campus and involved in typical student activities of the early 1960s. His campus friends say that he was known for his "neatly trimmed hair cut, an old red convertible car and a German shepherd with the name of `B-Z' which he boarded in a dog house behind the Dairy Queen."

Captain Brandenstein returned to the campus after his space flights, gave lectures to the students and faculty, and told students that "one of the things you see from space is the fragile planet we live on ... and that there is more desert on Earth than one would believe ... Once we louse up the atmosphere, it's all over. We can't go down to the store and buy another."

"Brandy" may be remembered on campus as one who helped get the cannon that booms after each touchdown at football games as well as having been a good student active in campus activities, but he will also be remembered as the distinguished astronaut who was proud to wear a "Freddy Falcon" T-shirt around the world hundreds of times. After the football game on Ramer Field, Oct. 27, 1990, there was the release of hundreds of balloons, followed by a ceremony dedicating the new addition to the Hagestad Student Center that will always be known as plain "Brandy's."

Miss Hathorn joined the faculty as Dean of Women in 1920 and retired in 1949. She was born in Jamestown, N.D., July 1, 1883, but attended high school in Minneapolis and Buffalo, N.Y. She had roots in Wisconsin, however, for when President Kleinpell asked for her approval of the name "Hathorn Hall" she wrote: "It makes me very happy to know that you plan to name the new dormitory for me. My father was from Wisconsin and his family lived in the state for many years, so I am filled with pride that I am able to give some permanence to the name `Hathorn' in this state." Her letter continues, "It is just thirty years this fall since I came to River Falls with the hope the girls would have a dormitory in a few years. I am sure that dormitory life will mean much more than the present student body realizes."

There was a precursor to Hathorn Hall. A house on Fourth Street that had been included in a land purchase was made into living quarters for a dozen or more women and named "Hathorn Cottage." Marion Hawkins, of the English department, and her mother served as "house mothers."

When Dean Hathorn retired she said, "There have been many changes during the years I have been here. Some of the most interesting developments in which I have had a part were the beginning of a student activity fee, a student social committee, the Student Senate, the Honor Society, the student health service and Mother's Day (a day when mothers of students were invited to the campus)."

Hathorn ... Her awareness of students' needs, her desire to see a dormitory established on this campus, her hobby of foreign travel, her wide reading -- all impressed me." A 1949 graduate who worked her way through college reported that Dean Hathorn always helped her to find jobs and wanted to be sure that they were satisfactory.

As was the case with many Deans of Women of that era, stories, probably apocryphal, circulated on campus about Dean Hathorn's instructions to women students. If they sat on men's laps, they were to place a newspaper under them. They were not to wear patent leather shoes (they acted as mirrors) to a dance. They were not to wear red, a color that aroused men.

When Walter H. Hunt died in 1942, the River Falls Journal said of him that he "was known as a good citizen, a friendly and sociable neighbor, and perhaps was one of the most popular masters of ceremony at the annual Teachers College homecoming mass meetings each fall.

Hundreds of boys and girls scattered all over the globe will be saddened to learn of Senator Hunt's death." He was especially interested in athletics, baseball and football being his favorite sports, as he had at one time played a fair game on the diamond. A former student once said that "there wasn't a pep meeting without a stirring speech from Walter Hunt."

Walter Hunt had made to the college and to education in Wisconsin. The arena, he said, will enrich the geographic area served by Hunt as a state senator, as a teacher and as a school inspector in his life time.

Medal winner gave an insight as to ways the new arena would enhance campus life in the years ahead. Professor/Senator Hunt would be pleased to know that sports have a better home now than in the years when he made stirring speeches at the pep rallies or argued for more legislative support for the college at River Falls.

Madison (B.S.) and Iowa State College (M.S.), taught high school, served in the Artillery as a lieutenant in World War I and then joined the staff of the Normal School at River Falls. River Falls had just been authorized to establish a department for teaching agriculture and Johnson became the manager of the embryonic farm that was to serve as a laboratory.

After buying a few good cows, a milk bottling shed was set up and bottled milk was delivered with a push cart by students, making the farm self-sufficient. In time milk was delivered by a horse-drawn wagon. "Old Bill," the horse, was trained so that he knew every stop, street and alley. Johnson wrote that Old Bill was retired after 20 years to spend his final days in the university pasture. When he died the students held a combined memorial service and commencement in North Hall. A B.S. degree was awarded Old Bill posthumously and in the eulogy, Professor Johnson said it was the first time the university had granted a degree to a whole horse.

Although Professor Johnson was too late to enjoy seeing the College of Agriculture become a well-known center for students in all aspects of agriculture, he did leave behind an annual scholarship for a student to study in that field. There are hundreds of former students who give him credit for launching them on significant careers.

The conference games usually played were with La Crosse and Superior. He said the trip to either college was quite an experience for the boys at that time. "We went by sleigh to Prescott and then took the train to La Crosse."

After returning to live in River Falls, he was a familiar figure on campus and attended most of the home football and basketball games. He took part in laying the cornerstone for the Karges Physical Education Center in 1959.

In tribute to him, President E. H. Kleinpell wrote that he "combined in a single personality the most admirable of all attributes of a teacher -- an interest in young people and a concern in their welfare, dedication to a field of learning, a wide range of interests outside his specialty and an intense loyalty to `his' college."

Kleinpell had one thought foremost in his mind: the future of the college at River Falls. It dominated his every waking moment. Perhaps it even invaded his sleep, for he had great dreams for the institution.

Teachers College, where he had served as president. The enrollment in 1945-46 had been 211 students. The physical plant consisted of North Hall, South Hall, an Industrial Arts Building, the Health Cottage and two barns for the College Farm along with a converted army barracks for married students. He foresaw the return of veterans to the campus and increasing demands on higher education.

When he resigned 21 years later, the enrollment was 3,545, five major academic buildings, nine residence halls and a new heating plant had been added. The college farms had added more than 300 acres. All this had not come easily. But from his own experience, Dr. Kleinpell knew the value of education. Born in Monona, Iowa, the only son of a harness maker and his wife, he attended the University of Iowa to earn his bachelor's degree. At the University of Chicago he received the master's degree and, at the University of Ohio, the Ph.D. in history. He was the first president at River Falls to hold the doctorate.

Dr. Kleinpell instituted the general education (later basic studies) program and pushed for the addition of liberal arts courses to the College's offerings. He arranged for establishment of the Alumni Foundation -- a first for a State Teachers College in Wisconsin.

He enjoyed working with students and maintained an "open door" policy. Students could see him at any time. He kept a supply of candy bars in his office and pupils from the campus school soon learned of the "open door" and "treats" available. He had many grade school visitors.

One of his favorite quotations was Robert Browning's, "A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?" President Kleinpell sought change. He once told a faculty member, "If you have a new idea you want to try, go ahead. If you fall flat on your face, I won't hold it against you." To find directions for change, he instituted a "Biennial Survey." Every two years faculty members were asked to list "strengths" and "weaknesses" of the institution and to suggest ways to build on the strengths and overcome the weaknesses. He read the survey returns carefully.

President Kleinpell contributed to higher education in Wisconsin in more ways than leading the River Falls campus. When the Coordinating Council for Higher Education was established in 1956, he was appointed as the representative of the State Colleges to serve on the joint staff. He gave all his energy to both his job as president and his joint staff position. He served in the latter job for six years without extra compensation.

University in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., but then returned to River Falls where he wrote In the Shadow, a book recounting the struggles of a small institution to gain funding and recognition when it lives in the shadow of the dominant large state campus. The work was published in 1975.

Attached to the south wall of the Kleinpell Fine Arts Building, the sundial was placed in recognition of the services of Richard D. Swensen, who joined the River Falls faculty in 1955 and served as chairman of the chemistry department and, from 1969 to 1988, as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 1988 he returned to teaching and retired in 1993. As dean, he instituted faculty exchanges both in Europe and the Pacific Rim and brought numerous internationally recognized individuals and groups to the campus.

In June of 1970 Dean Swensen, Grace Swensen and their six children went on a camping trip to Europe, including time in Heidelberg, Germany. It was during the visit to the castle in Heidelberg that Dean Swensen saw the large, vertical face sundial on the wall of the castle.

The vertical sundial was designed by Dr. John Shepherd, a member of the physics department. It represents fields in which Dr. Swensen is keenly interested: Science - represented by the precision of time keeping and the study of astronomy; History - the sundial is the oldest known instrument to measure the passage of hours and days; Art - the reproduction and presentation of information; Multiculturalism - sundials are found all over the world in many cultures. The sundial, with a horizontal measurement of 56 feet and a vertical measurement of 31 feet, is the largest and most accurate one of its kind in North America and is a striking functional sculpture.

She received her M.S. in teaching degree with a major in English at the fall commencement in 1972 at the age of 86. She had received her bachelor's degree in history at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1908. She began working on her master's degree in 1968 taking a night class. Later, she began commuting 40 miles from her home in Osceola where she served as editor of the Osceola Sun, a weekly newspaper that had been operated by her late husband.

Her story made the Associated Press wire and appeared along with a picture of her and her advisor, Dr. Marion Hawkins, from coast to coast. She said, "I'm going to continue to study, of course. I have the study habit so deeply that I couldn't get rid of it if I wanted. Let me tell you, if I were a younger woman I'd be beginning my Ph.D."

Dr. Davis had joined the university faculty in 1949, after having an undergraduate degree from Illinois State University and the Ph.D. from Columbia University. In her career she developed the speech and theatre programs and enhanced the role of theatre on campus and in the community.

Professor Dick Swensen said he was "always impressed with the high quality of her productions, which were comparable to any fine university production in the country." Her colleagues knew her to be an efficient and hard worker, yet "a pleasure to work with." Students knew that she demanded high standards in all that she did. Assistant Chancellor Wayne Wolfe said that students would always "put her at the top of the list when they remember River Falls."

One night two of Dr. Davis' colleagues drove down Cascade and noted that only three lights were burning in South Hall. Professor Vera Moss observed that "only Blanche Davis and the bathrooms are working."

When she returned for the dedication of the Blanche Davis Theatre, her colleagues paid tribute to her many contributions to the theatre at the university. An artist's view of her was presented after the ceremony and a scholarship has been contributed by her friends to a student in the department.

Alberta Greene joined the faculty at River Falls in 1923 and taught art here until her retirement in 1945. She had received her B.S. degree from Teachers College, Columbia University. She came as director of the art department but, for many of the early years, she was the art department.

John's University where he had studied for the priesthood. While a student here he participated in the Soviet Seminar and later made a bicycle tour of Hawaii and other places. Though he had a serious automobile accident after graduation, his interest in the world was not diminished. He met his tragic death in a plane crash on Mt. Denali, Alaska, at the age of 30 years.

Dr. Ruth Hale, chair of the Department of Geography, said of him that "he had an unbounded curiosity about people and places," was always open to new adventures and "in his short life he crammed about as much living into his years as was humanly possible." The Geography Department's Student Resource Room was named in honor of this "very special young man."

This room is dedicated to Nicholas Jadinak who served on the Music Department faculty from 1947 to 1974. His specialty was the violin but he taught general music courses in both the campus school and university orchestras over the years. Elliot Wold, the long-time chairman of the Music Department, said that Nicholas Jadinak never missed a day of teaching over the years and was a dedicated member of the Community Orchestra that has provided so many musicians an opportunity to perform.

When Dr. Gilbert N. Smith retired in 1972 after having been on the economics staff for 21 years, a room in the Kleinpell Fine Arts Building was named to honor him for his many years of service. Dr. Smith was proud to say that he had grown up on one of the longest streams in America, Lodgepole Creek in Nebraska, and often returned to his old home where life for dry country farmers had been hard in the depression years.

College and the University of Nebraska. He had taught economics at several universities before joining the UW-River Falls staff in 1952. When he retired, he expressed the hope that he had "accomplished the main objective of stimulating and challenging students." His colleagues spoke of him as "a dedicated teacher" and as "one of the giants of the faculty."

Bob Knowles had an early taste for government. He was one of a small group of students advocating the establishment of a Student Senate and was elected as a member when it was organized in 1938. Prior to that his only claim to fame, he said, was that, in 1928, as a campus school student, "I climbed through a window at North Hall and became the first to test the swimming hole which was then being filled with dirty, muddy test water."

He was born just three blocks from campus and, earlier, his family had lived in a house on the site of the present Student Center. After he finished high school in 1934 he enrolled at River Falls State Teachers College and, later, wrote, "I'm sure our most vivid recollection is of how poor everyone was. We have learned not to talk too much about it, for later generations simply do not believe us. I guess we really didn't feel poor at the time, since everybody was in the same boat. I clerked in a grocery store and worked in a filling station for 15 cents an hour."

He had a quick wit and a ready sense of humor. During a question and answer session after he had spoken on campus, he was asked, "Why are there so many stupid senators?" He shot back immediately, "There are a number of stupid people in Wisconsin and, under our system of government, they're entitled to representation, too."

During the 1960 Republican National Convention he served as assistant housing director and as executive secretary to the arrangements committee for the 1964 and 1968 conventions. He was one of three state legislators appointed by Pres. Nixon to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.

Knowles was appointed to the Board of Regents in 1980 and elected vice-president of that body in 1982. At the time of the Centennial Celebration on campus in 1974-75 he wrote, "It has been with mixed emotions that I have observed the college at River Falls mushroom into a full-blown university campus. While I sponsored and promoted the needed new buildings to accommodate the growth of the school, I fought against its merger into the University System, fearing that for those of us whose eyes get misty on hearing the playing of the pledge song, that some of the special and unique flavor of the school that we knew might be lost in the vastness of the University of Wisconsin."

When he became ill, Knowles offered to resign from the Board of Regents but Gov. Earl refused to accept the resignation. Knowles had been the Republican leader in the Senate when Earl was Democratic leader in the Assembly. Knowles died Nov. 3, 1985. At that time Earl said, "He regularly showed me great kindness and was a heavy influence on me."

Probably State Senate President Fred Risser, a Democrat, best expressed what many felt when he said, "State Senator Bob Knowles was a legislator's legislator. His imprint can be found on practically all state legislative activities during the 1960's and 1970's. Bob Knowles was a leader, a man of integrity and compassion and a friend to all who knew him."

The College of Agriculture is a monument to John M. May more than to any other person. He fought the long battle to strengthen the teaching of agriculture on this campus and held the program together through World War I, World War II and the Korean War. When he retired in 1957, farm organizations far and wide honored him, but none more heart-warming than the testimonial dinner in 1956 given him by the many former students who came from coast to coast to pay tribute to him. They presented him with a bound volume of letters of appreciation, a watch, boxes of cigars, a lawn mower, golf balls and even enough cash to last for years, he said. President Kleinpell said at that time that, "Nothing satisfies an administrator like knowing he had on his staff a man who has done an outstanding job for his kids and community."

John May had grown up on a farm in Nebraska, had a B.S. degree from Kansas College and a M.S. degree from Cornell University. After teaching in high school, he joined the River Falls Normal faculty that had just been authorized to offer a two-year program in agriculture for teachers. He spent his career developing that program beyond teacher education into a number of fields.

In the 40 years he was head of a department, or a division, or a college of agriculture he became widely known in educational circles throughout the Midwest and as one of the early pioneers in preparing teachers of agriculture for Smith-Hughes high schools. He helped take the River Falls agriculture program from zero years to three years to four years, but retired at the time when the fifth year programs came along. He is remembered as an able professor who worked quietly as the director of agriculture on this campus, which graduated hundreds of young people for careers in agriculture.

"... At no time has a class graduated from this school when there was greater need for earnest, honest conscientious work than now. Your Alma Mater looks to you to do your part toward bringing in an era of a better Americanism, a more devoted patriotism."

Though there were students who wrote in this same Meletean that "I am my own bright and shining light" and "The way she studies and writes/Gives us flunkers forty frights," Mary McMillan was an accomplished teacher of mathematics in the Normal School faculty of 18 dedicated to preparing teachers for the elementary schools -- one room "rural" or village schools.

"provide better educational opportunities for their daughters." After graduating from high school she went on to Stevens Point Normal to prepare for a teaching career, later taking a Bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1903. After teaching mathematics in Wisconsin Rapids, Marshfield and Ashland schools, she joined the River Falls Normal faculty in 1914. A former student remembered her as a "woman of outstanding qualities. She was blessed with a remarkable memory and her mental facilities remained sharp, almost to the time of her death. ..."

In her career, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Northland College and was the first woman ever to receive the honor of "Citizen of the Year" in Wisconsin Rapids. She served on the library boards of cities in both Florida and Wisconsin.

Board accepted the name of "Mary McMillan" for the new residence hall just completed in 1966, those former McMillan students welcomed this honor in the memory of a dedicated teacher. In her will Mary McMillan (Burt) also left an endowment fund to provide annually a scholarship in mathematics.

Nelson took a leave of absence from her River Falls responsibilities to serve as its executive secretary and led the colleges and universities into the field of women's competitive sports. She was head of the physical education department from 1970-73 and was assistant to the vice chancellor for academic affairs after 1973.

There was scarcely a statewide committee in the UW System or the public schools on which Nelson did not serve. She was president of the Wisconsin Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation, on the search committee for the president of the University of Wisconsin System and on a number of local and state task forces and committees on faculty development, women in administration, physical education and women's athletics. She served area public schools as a health education and curriculum consultant and served on the Board of Education of the River Falls Public Schools from 1975-78. During her years on the faculty she coached women's basketball, track and softball and was adviser to the Women's Recreation Association and Delta Psi Kappa. She served a five-year term on the Faculty Senate.

Hoping to see many of her former students, she conceived the idea of a 20th anniversary celebration of the UW-River Falls physical education major and planned a Homecoming for physical education alumni on Oct. 13, 1984. Her hopes were never realized, for she died Aug. 15, 1984. She had been on medical leave from her campus duties for more than two years.

"Emogene Nelson was a talented and caring teacher, a skilled administrator and an active force among our alumni and in the community. She will be missed by all of us," said Chancellor George Field at the time of her death.

A wing of May Hall was named The Nelson Center as a memorial to her at a dedication ceremony Nov. 15, 1986. The University Wrestling Team facility is on the first floor and the Human Performance Laboratory is on the lower level. The latter contains facilities for performing cardiovascular testing and high speed cinematographic recording and analysis. Physical rehabilitation and training for athletes and other students is also available. The lab is used extensively by students enrolled in the Exercise Physiology, Kinesiology, Tests and Measurement, Beginning Lab Research and Techniques of Biomedical Analysis courses.

There were two figures that stand out prominently on that morning, one was Thomas J. Martin, our first janitor, and the other, W. D. Parker, the first president, and I confess that on that day, I stood as much in awe of the one as the other." By 10 o'clock that morning, the President had divided the students into five sections and the first River Falls Normal School was under way.

Parker's family were New Englanders who immigrated to Wisconsin when he was 14 years old, locating near Janesville where he could get a high school education and later attend the University of Wisconsin at Madison. In subsequent years he became a teacher, superintendent of high schools and state inspector of high schools who helped set standards in schools throughout Wisconsin. He also organized and served as superintendent of the first school for the blind.

Wisconsin where a normal school had been authorized the year before despite bitter opposition from other towns that wanted it. By 1875, there was a building now known as South Hall, but not even a railroad to bring students to town from the region. There were no sidewalks except on Main Street, no electric lights, one well with a pump and tin cup attached. But students remembered not the hardships of travel or the inconveniences of starting to become teachers in a new school, but only the daily assemblies when President Parker read excerpts from good books and gave short speeches to encourage the students to become honorable leaders of children. One favorite quotation from Jonathan Edwards was: "Resolved never to do anything which I would be afraid to do as if it were the last hour of my life." The daily assemblies ended with his favorite song "A Perfect Day."

Crisis struck the Normal School in 1897 when fire destroyed what some called the "Cathedral of Learning." Before the fire had leveled the building, Parker mounted a nearby wagon to announce that classes would meet the next day downtown and called a meeting of townspeople arranging meeting rooms for months ahead. Later he proudly said that the fire cost the students only one-half day of classes.

Parker was one of the influential educators of the Midwest. He was a pioneer in establishing schools in Wisconsin and in making studies relate to everyday life. A colleague said of him that he was "a well-rounded and unusual man. ... Whatever profession he might have chosen he would have adorned; whatever pursuit might have won his endeavors he would have been recognized among its leaders. ..."

Normal School in 1908. His first teaching job was in a country school in Two Creeks in 1909. He served next as principal of the elementary school in Mishicot and then attended the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin earning the M.S. degree before coming to River Falls.

He also is credited with saving the River Falls golf course. In the worst part of the drought of the Dust Bowl years (early 1930s), the fairways on the course were burned brown and the soil was rock-hard. The club's financial situation was precarious and the Board of Directors was on the point of giving up. Prucha persuaded them that the mixture of Kentucky blue grass and red fescue used on the fairways would come back when the rains returned. The board voted, by a narrow margin, to hang on. When the rains returned in 1937 and 1938 the fairways became green and the course was preserved.

The Prucha home was less than 600 feet from the fire station and Prucha's son, John, writes of being terrified when the siren sounded in the wee hours of the morning. When his father discovered this, he told John, "Oh, you don't worry. When the siren wakes you, just roll over and feel the wall next to your bed. If it's not hot you know that our house is not on fire and you don't have anything to worry about!"

Commenting on the loss to the College, Pres. E. H. Kleinpell said, "Ed Prucha is an outstanding example of a man who devoted his life to education and to his students. His counsel and advice will be missed by all of us. Often carrying a heavy administrative and teaching load, he always had time to care about the problems of others and to keep a sense of perspective and a sense of humor. He went out of his way to commend a student or fellow faculty member on any achievement."

"River Falls will always feel grateful to Phillip W. Ramer for the sagacious diplomacy and diligent endeavor through which he is credited with saving the Teachers College for this city and establishing it as one of the leading institutions of its kind in the state. ... To perpetuate this appreciation throughout the years to come, the athletic grounds of the College have been named `Ramer Field' that alumni returning for homecomings, undergraduates watching or participating in College games ... may ever be reminded of the grand old man whose devotion meant so much to the success and progress of the institution and the community."

Thus said the River Falls Journal when P. W. Ramer died Feb. 20, 1933, at the age of 73 after having served as Regent from 1913 to 1929. Born in Lewiston, Minn., in 1859, he had lived in a sod house in North Dakota the first years of his marriage, drove a horse and buggy to town, then became a salesman for Quaker Oats and introduced its products throughout the world. Being a world citizen when he settled down in River Falls in the early 1900s, he played a major role in community life and enjoyed hunting and fishing with his friends. When he was appointed to the Board of Normal School Regents, he devoted his time and energy to getting appropriations for the Normal School that became a four year Teachers College. As President J. H. Ames said of him, he had "political savvy to affect the legislature" in appropriations and policies for developing the State College system in Wisconsin. At the community dinner given in Ramer's honor, Ames said further that Ramer was "a man who was never afraid, never downcast, a man who looked ahead. ...

Ramer fought the battle for North Hall in 1914 and won the confidence of the state in the future of the River Falls college." It was fitting that his funeral be held in the North Hall Auditorium and that the athletic field be named in his honor.

When the enrollment increased so fast after World War II and space was needed for additional residence hall and food service buildings, additional land was purchased south of the campus and the "old" Ramer Field was occupied by Rodli Commons and other structures. The new Ramer Field now serves the athletic teams and is used for other activities.

David Rodli was appointed to the Board of Regents in 1959 and was president of the Board at the time of his death in 1965. Gov. Gaylord Nelson saw the State Colleges as regional institutions and broke with tradition when he appointed a regent who was not a resident of the community in which the college was located. "Doc" Rodli (he got the nickname because his father was a physician) was manager of the St. Croix Electrical Cooperative in Baldwin when he was named to the board.

Wisconsin. He consistently argued against raising student fees and voiced his conviction that the state should be moving in the other direction, providing educational opportunity for all who could benefit from it rather than only to those who could afford it. He saw education as an investment that paid handsome dividends to the nation. He opposed restricting freshmen enrollments for the same reasons, believing everyone should be given a chance to try.

The respect and esteem of his colleagues on the Board were apparent when they elected him president in 1963. He led a "revolt" of the regents in 1962 but in a quiet, subtle way, so that there's little evidence that many were aware of it. The issue was a major in journalism at River Falls.

President Kleinpell had become enthusiastic about such a major and apparently had communicated his zeal to the regent. No state college had a journalism major and the only ones in Wisconsin were at Madison and at Marquette University in Milwaukee. When "Doc" learned that the staff at the Director's Office in Madison was planning to recommend against the major he said some of the bureaucrats had become "too big for their britches." Obviously, he talked privately with other regents. When he introduced a resolution granting the major at River Falls, one regent voted "present" and all others supported the resolution. Reportedly, it was the first time the Board had overturned a staff recommendation. Rodli also introduced the resolutions for naming May Hall and the J.H. Ames Laboratory School.

Regent Rodli died at his home of a heart attack Feb. 15, 1965, when he was less than 55 years old. In a personal reminiscence, published Feb. 25, 1965, the editor of The Baldwin Bulletin wrote that Mr. Rodli was "deeply interested in education. I got to know and admire him as a man of deep conviction, a most capable and exacting person who wanted to know the `why and the where' of every subject we discussed." And in The Royal Purple, the student newspaper at Whitewater State College, where he was president, Dr. Walker Wyman wrote, "To this regent ... a campus should be a place where students could learn about all the great ideas. ... Controversial speakers and books enriched campus life, prepared students to live in the real world that is full of controversy. Freedom was an article of faith to David Rodli."

Delorit said, "One did not have to know Mr. Rodli very long to know that he loved life and lived it fully. Although he was aware of his health, he continued to give fully of himself to his profession, to his community, and to his task as a regent."

Rodli didn't have many lines in his face, and most of them branched out from the corner of his eyes, the tracks of countless visions of his smile. The lower part of the smile was often wrapped around the end of a pipe and the other part around the eyes which had a mischievous quality that you were never quite sure what it said. For each of us, perhaps he held something behind that smile and as he took it out the door we thought that maybe next time we would find out just what it was and he looked forward to meeting you again on the day quite unlike the winter day of interment in Baldwin."

Stratton came to River Falls in 1915 after attending Michigan schools and later was awarded an honorary doctorate by Michigan State College at Ypsilanti. In early days here, according to him, he taught nine classes five days a week in a lecture room that had one table, a few chairs, but no maps or texts. After the Nov. 11, 1918, Armistice of World War I, he took a leave of absence to serve as a cartographer with the Commission to Negotiate Peace in Paris. When he returned to River Falls he was appointed Dean of Men, a position that had few duties, he said, except to report student absences.

Armed Services around the world, he sent them letters reporting on campus life. In one letter he told that two custodians of North and South Halls had resigned and he was campaigning for one of the jobs. At one time during the war he was sending out letters to hundreds of service men, paying the postage from his own pocket. He helped students on campus to keep the Service Flag that hung on the South Hall wall up-to-date, a star for each soldier, a gold star for those killed in action.

Dr. Stratton found time to serve as weather observer for the U.S. Weather Service, recording temperatures, rains, snows and other weather each day. Citing his 36 years as a weather observer, he reported at a testimonial dinner held in his honor at his retirement in 1955 that his work had been totally useless. He had walked 300 miles from his house to the weather instruments in his back yard and had driven 5,000 miles to mail the daily report at the Post Office, and had never received one cent, only some equipment -- a blank weather map, a monthly report sheet and three pencils! He said that President Roosevelt "took away the map, Truman took away the weather report, and Eisenhower quit issuing pencils."

Fortunately, Dr. Stratton attended the dedication of Stratton Hall in 1958 when his idealism, scholarship and humor were recalled, and his friends and former students later established a scholarship in his name.

Kleinpell enthusiastic about the idea and supportive all during the construction period. A great deal of labor went into the project, much of it during the summer by students who lugged slabs of limestone for the seating circles. Hundreds of students aided by faculty and friends of the university waded in mud to level the area, lay sod and haul dirt.

The UW-River Falls Foundation was a new and active force for idealism in the early 1960s and the improvement of the south campus became a major goal. The drive had considerable assistance with the Axel Foundation contributing $2,000 and former student, W. H. Hunt, offering $20,000 as a challenge gift to match student, faculty and alumni contributions. The amphitheatre is used for Commencement and other programs such as a music series during the summer. At the dedication ceremony in 1972 the Minnesota Orchestra gave an outdoor performance. Also a memorial to Dr. Wall is the fountain, donated by his widow, Margaret, and located in the mall between South Hall and Hagestad Student Center.

Dr. Wall was appointed to an eight-man survey team to study Vietnam's system of higher education. The first such study ever made, it was a joint effort of the government of Vietnam and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The team left on Jan. 2, 1967, and had completed the first phase of the study -- a survey of existing conditions -- and had made a preliminary report on the second phase -- long range needs and implementation. All members of the group, along with the pilot, were killed March 25 when their plane crashed into a mountain north of DaNang during turbulent, rainy weather. He was granted the Distinguished Alumnus Award, posthumously, at the 1967 Commencement.

In paying tribute to Wall, President E. H. Kleinpell said: "In addition to the sense of personal loss his colleagues at the University feel in the death of Melvin Wall, there is also a great loss to the institution. Wall devoted 27 years of his life to the University from which he was graduated and had great influence on its students and alumni. His interest in the University went beyond the classroom and included all aspects of its welfare. As chairman of the campus planning committee, he did much to preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the River Falls Campus ...

Wisconsin-Whitewater during a period of extensive growth to accommodate a generation of "baby boomers" seeking a university education. During his tenure, more than 3,000 persons were added to the student body and 20 new buildings were completed or started. The campus mall there is named in his honor.

The purpose of the Western Wisconsin Partnership for Children and Families is to improve the quality of services provided to children at risk of out-of-home placement and their families through a comprehensive, competency-based child welfare training system.

The training system  includes a variety of learning mediums. Most of the training happens in workshops held in sites throughout the Western region. Gradually, the use of more distance education technologies will allow for workshops to be held more frequently and more locally. The content of training is  determined through a variety of methods. Feedback solicited from participants after each workshop, regular meetings with agency supervisors, as well as with DCFS staff, is used to determine training content. Specifically trained agency staff, as well as other local and national experts, are used as trainers and to develop training curriculum.

The training curriculum will include CORE courses that are designed primarily for new workers as well as advanced training for experienced workers, supervisors and directors. The curriculum used for training is well established and used throughout the United States. It reflects best practice in the field of child welfare and is based on social work values and principles. Training is now being extended to foster and adoptive parents as well as the staff that support them.

Another learning medium is this WEB site which links workers to a wide variety of resources on topics relevant to child welfare practice. A library of print and video materials is also available. Eventually distance education technology will be incorporated into the training system to support the learning that happens in workshops. Linked to the curriculum are a variety of tools available to child welfare supervisors that will support them as they help workers prepare for workshops and incorporate what they have learned in those workshops into every day practice.

This course studies historical and contemporary primary texts by and about women which reveal origins and explanations of women's place in cultures and societies. It further studies the history of women's organized response to their position in cultures and societies.

This course will examine images of scientists, the history of women in science, current gender issues facing men and women in science and feminist philosophies of science. In order to understand these, the course will attempt to define science, technology and feminism.  The course will also address issues of other under-represented groups in science.

This course addresses a variety of topics in women's studies.  Topics may change with each offering, although some may be repeated.  Possible topics could include women and film, anthropology and gender, sexuality in culture, and feminist theory.

This course includes directed studies on a women's issue, probably in the student's major field, to be approved by the Women's Studies Committee as a whole and to be supervised by a designated faculty member of the committee in conjunction (if necessary) with a selected faculty member in the field of the study.  A final research paper in the range of 15-20 pages will result from the student's directed study.

The course is designed as a survey of many areas of law which have a significant impact on the lives of American women, including employment, marriage, divorce, reproduction, education and criminal justice. Emphasis on legal issues concerning discrimination against both women and men.

This course examines the role which discrimination plays in erecting economic barriers for women and minorities in the U.S. economy. The course will critically examine how current economic theories account for the lower status of these groups. In light of the theoretical discussion we consider the usefulness of proposed policies in rectifying the situation. May be used by Business Administration majors as a liberal arts course if the student does not have a major or minor in economics.

This course is a study, intended for women and men, of the tradition of literature by women and its relationship to movements and periods of the mainstream male-dominated canon. It also includes a look at the relationship between woman as writer and woman as subject in literary history.

This course explores the literary, historical and psychological structures of various forms of autobiography. Students will explore constant and changing cultural, artistic and psychological concerns and will investigate, analyze and appreciate the widely differing purposes of such works. The racial and ethnic diversity of American autobiography is a major emphasis in the course. Authors to be studied may include Maxine Hong Kingston, Malcolm X, Maya Angelou, Lillian Hellman, Booker T. Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Harriet Jacobs, N. Scott Momaday, Audre Lorde and Donald Hall.

This course will study a number of issues pertaining to women and film: the history of women's cinema, prominent women directors and genres, images of women in film and feminist issues in film.  Co-listed as ENG 300/500.

American women writers of high literary merit representing Black, Native American, Asian and Hispanic backgrounds will be studied. This course will explore the racial, ethnic and sexual oppression experienced by women of color in American history as it is expressed in literature. The emphasis will be on twentieth century literature, with special attention to a basic American literary theme: the search for personal identity.

Designed to provide an understanding of the content and methodology of teaching sex education and family life education in the school setting. A framework for planning a comprehensive family life program for K-12 levels will be discussed as well as available materials, DPI recommendations and community attitudes and controls.

U.S. Women's History  will offer a multicultural approach to the history of women in the United States. Beginning with the period of contact between Native Americans and Europeans, it emphasizes the ways that historical developments and social institutions have affected women differently depending on race, class, and ethnicity.

This course will explore central issues surrounding women and history in the Western world (outside America). The focus will be on the ancient and classical world of Western civilization, examining the beginnings of patriarchy; representations of women in the modern era, emphasizing  Europe; theoretical frameworks that examine women's oppression historically; and the effects of colonialism and post-colonialism on (non-U.S.) women in the Western Hemisphere.

In this course students will examine women's political movements, public policies which affect the relative status of women and men, the role of women in electoral politics and the ways in ideas about gender have shaped political life. Our analysis will include examples from politics in the United State and also from other nations. Co-listed as Women's Studies 314.

This course provides a broad survey of literature and psychological research concerning sex differences and gender role development with an emphasis on exploring both the similarities and differences between females and males.  Some key topics include: historical perspectives of sex/gender, the "science" of studying sex/gender, physiological issues (e.g., reproduction, the brain), theories of gender acquisition (e.g., social learning, psychoanalytic), theories of sex differences, issues of thought and cognition, relationships, sexuality (normal and deviant), and the future of gender/sex. This course satisfies an elective in the Women's Study Minor.

This course analyzes the various social and social-psychological processes which are related to gender role identity and gender differentiated behavior.  The course also explores the relationships between gender stratification and the options and life-chances of men and women in the United States and across the world.

Family communication is an introduction to the communication phenomena in the setting of the family. The course will help the students to understand how communication develops, maintains, enhances, and/or destroys family relations. Students will study sex differences in communication; problems of single parenting and dual careers; traditional roles and changing roles within the family; and sex differences in intimacy, power, and decision making. The students will work toward equality in roles and power decisions through effective, fair communication which will help promote healthy family communication.

The emphasis of this course is on consciousness raising regarding similarities and differences in the communicative behaviors of women and men.  The class will consist of lectures, in-class experiential exercises, role-playing, and group discussions devoted to such topics as female-male roles and stereotypes; differences in female-male verbal and nonverbal codes; partnership styles and alternatives; specific communication skills aimed at female-male relationships in a variety of settings; and special problem areas in female-male communication.

Throughout most cultures and periods of history, women's status in society has been eclipsed by that of men. The result is a legacy of devaluation, which underlies historical and contemporary discriminatory practices and attitudes toward women.

As a result of this history, women's lives often have been different from men's in condition and quality.  The traditional university curriculum, while claiming that the study of "man" includes women, has often failed to examine women's lives, work and perceptions with depth or objectivity.

Women's Studies attracts students of both sexes because it endeavors to expose unexamined attitudes and to clarify newly developing attitudes, thus facilitating greater cooperation and more productive collaboration between the sexes.

Leader and front man of the most widely known and traveled band in America, Johnny Holm is the most entertaining entertainer performing today. The show is dedicated to the fans, and they do most of the entertaining. Mostly impromptu, the show moves with the speed of lightning and changes direction as soon as "the pied piper" notices a lag. "Never a dull moment" was never a more true description.Surrounding himself with the finest musicians in the Midwest, the band rocks, picks, and thunders along for 3-4 hours, almost non-stop from the first song to the last laugh.Millions of people have seen Johnny over the years, and millions of people have been part of his fantourage.The band plays in most of the United States but most dates are in the 5 state upper Midwest area.Ask anyone with a twinkle in their eye or a knowing smile about Johnny. They'll try and tell you all about the mayhem that masquerades as a rock and roll band.Be hip most of your life, but once and a while, let down and "get down Holm fever".

The River Falls campus is active with many activities to help with student development both in and out of the classroom. While River Falls has not held a state wide or regional conference; we have held many conferences for UW-River Falls students. Our bid team has worked together to put together a number of conferences for River Falls students which provide many programs similar to what Wisconsin students receive when they attend WURHA.

Porter, I am a Math major here at University Wisconsin River Falls. I am co-chair with Liz, for the Roll Call/Entertainment committee and we are really looking forward to seeing your school pics and cheers. I am excited to be going west with ya'll. I hope that ya'll are too.

Wisconsin called Presque Isle. I am a first year student at River Falls, and my RA is Nicole (one of the co-chairs). She rocks! I am interested in WURHA because I may get in to Marketing Communications and by being on the finance committee it gives me a chance to get a feel for what my future job may include. I hope this will be a good learning experience and that I make a lot of new friends along the way.

I am a Computer Technician at FredNet were I help on campus students with computer problems. I am the Joint-Foods Representative for my hall. I have recently joined Big Brothers Big Sisters and am enjoying the time I get to spend with my "little brother". When asked to join WURHA I was at first not sure if I would want to do it, but now I am very glad that I did.

You may recognize our speaker from KSTP-TV, Channel 5 in the Twin Cities where she has been forecasting the weather for the past seven years. She also works with children, conducting weather-awareness programs for elementary students.

Learning new information and bringing it back to your campus is one of the most important parts of attending this conference. Along with programs (sideshows) we will be having a roundtable (Round up Cattle) session. Programs and roundtables will allow delegates to communicate their ideas and also can be brought back to Wisconsin campuses.

Wipe the sleep from your eyes and join us down at Freddies for some excellent morning grub. The breakfast includes scrambled eggs, bacon, assorted pastries, sausage, and hashed browns. Eating all of this may make you feel a bit parched, which is why we have orange juice, coffee, and milk available.

Every cowgirl and cowboy needs some lunch to keep them moving throughout the day. Hop on down to Freddies and pick up your very own box lunch. This handy box lunch will include your choice of sandwich, whole fruit, a bag of chips, freshly baked cookies, and a choice of milk, juice, or pop.

Put on your best attire and join us at Knowles for a sit down dinner, put together by Chartwells Catering. As you walk down the buffet line, expect your mouth to water as you pass the meatless lasagana, the baked chicken, various salads, whipped potatoes, buttered noodles, green beans almondine, and corn.

Cross your fingers and hope your school has shown the most spirit as you head down to Knowles for the banquet. Expect a night of fine dining, energy, awards, and fun at the banquet, all guaranteed to bring WURHA to an exciting conclusion.

There will be many activities for our Buckaroos, Cowboys and girls all weekend long. On Friday night there will be the Wagon-train Pile-Up, Karaoke, a bon fire (weather permitting) rock climbing, and swimming. Saturday night, we will of course, be having the banquet, and then afterwards one of our own UWRF students will be helping us dance our feet off at the Barn Dance, while exchanging exotic items at the Trading Post.

Buckaroos, Cowboys and Cowgirls to the Wagon Train Pile-Up. This is an activity for each Wagon train to pick two delegates to represent them in a Family Feud-like game. Each delegate pair will be paired up with another and will compete for Spirit points against another team of delegates.

Today, approximately 5,800 students, attend River Falls. Our size also allows students to choose from 120 student organizations in which they can develop important leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. Living on campus helps build a sense of community within the residence halls among our first and second-year students. The nine residence halls are a great place to meet new friends and get involved in campus life. Over 90 percent of our freshmen live on campus.

Leadership Center where all of our student activities are based. Recognizing the powerful contributions out-of-class experiences make to personal development and student learning, the Leadership Center strives to maximize opportunities for students to be connected and engaged in every facet of campus life. The LC is the home of the following programs and activities: residence life, student activities, student organizations, intramurals, KinniConnections, the Body Shop, and student government.

The minimum number of semester credits required for "full-time" status is 12. Students may register for up to 18 credits per semester (17 credits for freshmen) without special permission and at no extra charge. Students who receive financial assistance must be careful that they do not drop below the 12 credit minimum. Less than full-time status may jeopardize eligibility requirements.

Students must obtain the approval of their advisor and of the Dean of their college in order to register for an excess load. Any sophomore, junior, or senior who wants to enroll in more than 18 credits or any freshman that wants to enroll in more than 17 credits must file an application for excess load.

If a student drops a class after 30 days, it is considered a late drop and must be for non-academic verifiable reasons. Must have signature of instructor, advisor, and the dean of the major department.

Student registration for a class, laboratory, or studio which has limited enrollment due to facilities, may be dropped from the course if the student is not present at the first session of the term, unless the absence was an unavoidable circumstance, including illness. If you must be absent on the first day of class, you should contact the instructor of the course.

An instructor may drop you from a class if you do not attend the first class meeting. If you do not plan to take a course, drop it; do not assume that non-attendance will result in an automatic drop. Drops will not be backdated because you never attended. The official drop date is the date you turn in the program change card to the Registrar's Office.

Students who wish to audit a course are required to register for the course after those enrolled for credit have registered (the fifth class day of each term, or the last day to add a class), on a space available basis with the following conditions: Any student who enrolls on an audit basis may NOT change to a credit basis during the term of enrollment.

Non degree-seeking students taking ONLY audit credit classes, may audit classes on a "space available" basis with the class instructor's approval at the per credit audit fee. Campus fees will not be charged, nor will comparable services be available.

Credits earned under the pass/fail system with a satisfactory grade ("S") will not be included in computing the student's GPA. An unsatisfactory ("U") in these courses is treated as an "F" and does effect the grade point average in that way.

Students who are undecided about a major or option should not take courses on a pass/fail basis which might later become part of their requirements. Students in pre-professional programs, including preparation for graduate study, should avoid taking courses under the pass/fail system which may be required or recommended for such study.

Students shall confer with their advisors in considering those courses which might be taken on a pass/fail basis. If it is determined that a student elected a course without being eligible or without meeting the requirements, the student will be required to carry the course on the conventional grading scale.

Students may request to repeat courses in which other grades were received only if there are extenuating circumstances. To request this exception, a Course Repeat Exception form must be completed and approved by the student's advisor, the chair of the department offering the course, and the student's dean BEFORE registration for the course.

The original grade will remain on the student's transcript. The new grade will replace the previous grade when computing the grade point average (GPA). If a student repeats a course and earns a lower new grade, the lower new grade will be used in the computation of the GPA.

Athletes should check with their coaches before repeating courses in which a grade of D was earned, as it may affect their athletic eligibility. Students receiving veterans' benefits may not count in benefit level determination those credits for which D's were previously earned.

Instructors indicate online any student who is not, based upon their judgment, currently attending their class and are asked to give a last known date of class attendance for those students who are not attending if possible.

The report is reviewed for those students with federal and state aid whom are assumed to have unofficially withdrawn from the University. The last date of attendance as reported by any of the instructors is determined and used in the Return of Title IV Funds calculation.

The Registrar's Office will provide verification of enrollment to insurance companies, lender institutions, or other agencies at your request. You must file a verification request form at the Registrar's Office. Your signature is required on the verification request form in order for us to release any restricted information.

Each Spring, superior scholarship is recognized by the awarding of Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior merits to those students enrolled during the Spring term. To receive merit, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.500 with no F's, outstanding incompletes, or repeat grades on their academic record.

In addition to these honors, many of the academic departments annually present awards to their student majors which recognize superior scholarship, leadership, or service to the department. Students should also be aware that many of the scholarships available at the University are designated for students with high academic achievement in specific majors or disciplines.

An Incomplete (grade of "I") is reported only when students are prevented from completing the required course work through no fault of their own. It is the responsibility of the student to see that all of the work is completed. Incompletes are not counted in computing a student's cumulative GPA. An incomplete must be removed from the record during the next two terms (excluding J-Term and Summer Session) or a grade designated by the instructor at the time the Incomplete is issued will automatically be awarded. Otherwise a grade of "F" will be recorded.

The cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total number of credits attempted. In the case of repeated courses the record of both the original and repeated course will be retained on the student's transcript, but for purposes of determining the student's GPA, only credits and grade points earned in the last retake of the course will be used.

Students that have previously attended UW-River Falls and have completed coursework at another institution, should have an official transcript sent directly to the Registrar's Office for evaluation of course work.

Students will be required to participate in orientation sessions before and during the tour. These orientation sessions will enable the students to get acquainted with different cultures, economic conditions, business practices, etc., and to prepare them for indepth study on specific global issues.

Note: If you have dropped credits or plan to drop credits during the semester please contact the Office of Financial Assistance to complete a "Special Handling Form" - this will help expedite processing and disbursement of the requested loan.

PELL Grant: A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. Generally, Pell Grants are awarded only to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. (A professional degree is usually earned after earning a bachelor's degree in a field such as medicine, law, or dentistry.) In some cases, you might receive a Pell Grant for attending a post-baccalaureate teacher certificate program.

Academic Competitive Grant: An Academic Competitiveness Grant will provide up to $750 for the first year of undergraduate study and up to $1,300 for the second year of undergraduate study to full-time students who are eligible for a Federal Pell Grant and who had successfully completed a rigorous high school program, as determined by the state or local education agency and recognized by the Secretary of Education. Second year students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0.

A Federal Perkins Loan is a low-interest (5 percent) loan for both undergraduate and graduate students with financial need. Your school is your lender. The loan is made with government funds with a share contributed by the school. You must repay this loan to your school.

Federal Stafford - Subsidized: This award is made on the basis of demonstrated financial need. The federal government pays the interest while the student is enrolled and for six months after the student drops below half time enrollment.

Federal Stafford - Unsubsidized: An Unsubsidized loan is not based upon financial need. The student must pay the interest monthly, quarterly, or have the interest capitalized (added to the principal) on the loan while in school. You may choose to borrow less than the award amount or not at all. If you borrow, further action on your part is necessary before the loan application can be created and processed.

They're loans your parents can take out to pay for your education expenses if you're a dependent undergraduate student enrolled at least half time.* Also, your parents must have no adverse credit history. PLUS Loans are unsubsidized (see web page).

These grants provide funds to undergraduate minority students who are of at least sophomore status. Applicants must be African-American, Latino, Native American or Southeast Asian. Southeast Asian student must be of Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian or Hmong heritage. Students must file a FAFSA so financial need or no need can be determined.

Qualifying minorities must be U.S. citizens, Wisconsin residents or have Minnesota reciprocity, enrolled at least half-time and making satisfactory academic progress. Students who demonstrate financial need must have a grade point average of 2.0 or better; students with no need for financial aid must have a grade point average of 2.4 or better to be considered. Contact the Academic Success Center for applications and information.

All aid is divided into two disbursements: Fall and Spring semesters. In most cases, the amount of aid will be distributed evenly over the two terms. Grants, scholarships, and Federal Perkins loans (if applicable) will be applied to direct costs, tuition, fees, room and board (if living on campus) and any other balance owed.

Indicate the number of credits for which you plan to enroll for each semester on the award letter. Any status changes occurring during the add/drop period at the beginning of each semester could result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. Adjustments will not be made on the spot. It is important to notify us about changes in your enrollment status at the time you submit your award letter for processing.

Federal Stafford - Unsubsidized:  An Unsubsidized loan is not based upon financial need. The student must pay the interest monthly, quarterly, or have the interest capitalized (added to the principal) on the loan while in school. You may choose to borrow less than the award amount or not at all. If you borrow, further action on your part is necessary before the loan application can be created and processed. These steps are listed below.

No, you're not charged any fees to take out the loan. But, if you skip a payment, make a payment late, or make less than a full payment, you might have to pay a late charge. If you continue not making payments as required, you might have to pay collection costs as well.

Yes. Your school must notify you in writing whenever it credits your account with your Perkins Loan funds. The school must send you this notification no earlier than 30 days before, and no later than 30 days after, the school credits your account. You may cancel all or a portion of your loan if you inform your school you wish to do so within 14 days after the date your school sends you this notice, or by the first day of the payment period, whichever is later. (Your school can tell you the first day of your payment period.) If you receive Perkins Loan funds directly by check, you may refuse the funds by returning the check.

If you're attending school at least half time, you have nine months after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half time* status before you must begin repayment (you might have longer than nine months if you're on active duty with the military). This period of time is called a grace period. If you're attending less than half time, check with your financial aid administrator to determine your grace period. At the end of your grace period, you must begin repaying your loan. You may be allowed up to 10 years to repay.

The Student Assistance work program is available to students who are not eligible for Work Study. This program is not based on need and any student wishing to work can secure employment, provided that jobs are available through the various departments. Contact the department directly to secure employment. These jobs are also posted on the job boards around campus, on the campus cable TV station (Channel 10), and at  http://www.uwrf.edu/ccs/vac_list/financial_aid.htm.

The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 requires that anyone employed after November 7, 1986, must complete an I-9 Verification Form and present two forms of identification within three working days of employment. This regulation includes student workers. Current procedures require that after you secure employment you MUST present the acceptable forms of identification and employment eligibility to your hiring department.

Complete all section of the on-line counseling session. The results from your completed session will be sent electronically to the Office of Financial Assistance to indicate the completion of this requirement.

Qualitative Standards: Students must meet the same qualitative (GPA) requirements as those established by the university related to academic suspension. The institutional policy requires that students must maintain a cumulative 2.0, it complies with the federal regulation from the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965.

Quantitative Standards: The first measure of quantitative academic progress requires that students enrolled in a full-time basis must earn 24 credits/academic year (or 12 credits/semester of attendance).

Should the student fail to successfully complete the first provision, quantitative evaluation defaults to a cumulative evaluation of multiple years which would require the inclusion of the semester minimum (12) times the number of semesters of post secondary attendance (e.g 5 semesters X 12 [minimum credits] = 60 [cumulative standard]).

Denial of Financial Assistance: Students who violate the established academic progress policy will be denied assistance for subsequent semesters. Students will be informed by the Office of Financial Assistance of their failure to make progress and their appeal options.

Appeal/Petition Procedures: Any student denied assistance may appeal for reinstatement. The Satisfactory Academic Appeal form must be in writing and must document the mitigating, extraordinary or unusual circumstances which led to the unsatisfactory progress. The appeals will be reviewed by the Office of Financial Assistance and the student will be notified of the outcome within two weeks of submission.

Successful Appeals: Students who successfully appeal will be reinstated for a single probationary semester. During that semester the student must demonstrate progress and meet the requirement list above.

Unsuccessful Appeals: Students who fail their appeal efforts or choose not to appeal may receive reconsideration by demonstrating progress and scheduling an appointment with the Office of Financial Assistance Director.

We honor the past in many ways including recognizing the seminal accomplishments of three of my distinguished predecessors here—George Field, Gary Thibodeau and Virgil Nylander. And we dearly remember and honor Ann Lydecker and her devotion to UW-River Falls.

We are here at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls where quality education and the pursuit of knowledge have been the resonant, personal, and institutional focus since 1874. For 132 years, teaching and learning have been the universal language connecting thousands of faculty, staff and students.

The legacy of the normal school and its relation to the future of the territories and states they served endures here at River Falls. Why was educating teachers one of the first collaborative, civic actions taken by those first settlers, those emerging societies? They needed teachers, and it was well understood that teachers and education were critical actors in the shaping of societies via the knowledge and skills they impart and the values they profess and model. For it is those values and those caretakers who helped shape our actions, our communities, and our world.

Today, UW-River Falls is a proud member of an internationally respected and lauded teaching and learning system, the University of Wisconsin. As President Reilly has articulated today and for many audiences, the UW System and each of its institutions, enthusiastically accept their responsibility to be the state’s premier developer of people and the potential that lies within each person. Collectively, the institutions of the UW System are a dynamic engine for development as our graduates create new economic opportunities for themselves and others, and fuel the future.

And we are equally charged with community enrichment, with building our communities via the cadre of engaged citizens who understand and accept public service as an integral part of their personal mission. These are horizons and goals that we at UW-River Falls embrace with great passion and commitment, for they are tangible reflections of our mission and our history. They are part of the answer to the query of why we show up every day, semester, year and for many, a lifetime.

We are gathered here in the opening moments of what will be the first true global century—a time of possibility for the most far-reaching, extensive contact among people on the planet in human history; an age when what we know and how we learn will be more important than where we live; an era, unprecedented in human history, when cross cultural collaboration may be the difference between economic success and failure.

Those connections will be vital to global political and human relations where globe-spanning challenges defy narrow and boilerplate solutions, and problems do not respect national borders. Each day we, our institutions, and society move deeper into the global century. Are we ready? How do we prepare ourselves, our students, and our society for success in this time, unlike no other?

We are here on Wisconsin’s western frontier in one of the most dynamic parts of the region with some of the country’s fastest growing counties. We are here where urban meets rural. How we tend to this historic transition may serve as a relevant model for rational, sustainable development here, in the USA and for other nations facing similar challenges. Led by our College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences in collaboration with its fellow colleges, UW-River Falls is uniquely positioned to respond to the challenges inherent in this change. We understand that we are stewards of this place and planners of our future.

We are here focused on Institutional Intentionality and the search for purpose, value and meaning. We create the world in which we work and fulfill our calling. It is a collaborative journey, powered by exceptional individual and group action gathered around common core values, mission, and vision.

Our focused core values, mission and vision have emerged from extensive campus and community contacts and our Vision and Values survey conducted last Fall. They will guide us through the next chapter of this historic institution’s development.

The survey confirmed that our students come to us searching for information and inspiration, facts and insights, analysis and direction. They are looking for their unique pathway to a job, a career and a meaningful life. They are seekers, and so are we.

We are intentional in inviting our students to a life of engagement and tolerance, of service and global literacy, of continually developing themselves both as citizens and leaders. We join with them in striving for academic excellence through the consistent development of their potential as critical thinkers, effective communicators and committed life-long learners, and servant leaders.

This personalized, integrated education is rooted in relationships; in people; in connections of expert, committed, caring faculty and staff, and curious, motivated, persistent students. In this chemistry lies the genius of education’s success. This connection—this bond of teaching and learning—is a true passion, an endemic life force for us at River Falls, and it has been for over 130 years.

We invite our students to a life of engagement. To foster our students’ engagement, we invite them to explore critical issues and give them models to help them overcome what Robert Jay Lifton identifies as the “broken connection” between their values and their actions, between the world they inherit and the one that they will pass on. One of the programs so dedicated is the American Democracy Project, a three-year-old national movement now enlisting over 200 institutions, Campus Compact and The New York Times, among other partners. Through this program and many others, we are dedicated to educating engaged citizens.

In the aftermath of the Katrina tragedy, each of us searched for our way to respond. UW-River Falls’ students, staff and faculty found their voice through one another, and through connecting immediately with staff and students at the University of Southern Mississippi. Collecting monies and goods for basic student needs when almost all was lost for their USM counterparts in the storms, the River Falls campus community decided to adopt a long-term perspective on the needs of the people of America’s Gulf Coast and, in doing so, gave fresh meaning to service, learning and leadership.

Among the results has been students traveling to the Gulf Coast over January Term and Spring Break to learn how to hang sheet rock, build roofs, clean up after nature’s fury, work together, and with people who they did not know and with some who had never met a college student, and certainly not any from this far north. Our River Falls team was moved by the spirit of service that brought the non-profit volunteers from around the nation to tend to this national wound. They were inspired. And they were inspiring to those they met in Mississippi, to their River Falls classmates when they returned, and to one another and to us. The unsolicited notes from people on the Gulf, those simple genuine expressions of profound gratitude, were more reward than they ever imagined. The spirit and power of service, of engagement and of leadership by example, by “modeling the way,” has had a home here for many years. The UW-River Falls “Destination Corps” acted in that tradition, and frankly, raised the bar of service and engagement for all of us.

In an appearance before the US Congress to receive the Medal of Freedom, former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel articulated our mission: “We are not alone, nor are we for ourselves alone.” That spirit is thriving here.

Over 6,000 individualized dreams will pass through our doors each semester, some fully formed, but most incomplete, masked, or subconscious. Each will be the manifestation of the sometimes vocalized, but often muted aspirations of an individual, family, tribe, community, state or country.

But, when we do it together, when we do it collaboratively, when we do it guided by common core values, mission, and vision, when we do it with expertise, experience, compassion and discipline, we together create that most wondrous of outcomes—a unique learning and living environment for our students and ourselves.

When we do it for the right reasons we create a formidable instrument of personal and societal change. We are a force for learning, leadership, and service for a community that stretches from River Falls, the St. Croix Valley, Wisconsin and around the globe. This is an expression of the Wisconsin Idea in the global century.

Some of the tools to advance learning, engagement, and leadership in a global perspective include undergraduate research, interdisciplinary learning, service learning, internships here and abroad, international study opportunities and sustained leadership development including the imminent launch of the Chancellor’s Leadership Class.

Undergraduate research is a particularly fruitful and encouraging approach to learning, and UW-River Falls has been among the institutions integrating these opportunities into the curriculum. CUR in their report last year labeled undergraduate research as “the pedagogy for the 21st century” and an essential mission for virtually all institutions. The central premise of undergraduate research is the formation of the collaborative enterprise between students and faculty. We are prepared to expand our existing serious commitment, and to join with our UW institution partners in exploring and sustaining this animated and potent approach to knowing and learning.

We are here to internationalize our education and our perspectives, to cultivate a world view and to pursue global literacy as an institutional and societal objective. We intend to expand our goal to “bring the world to River Falls and to take River Falls to the world.” To strive for less would neither fulfill our core values nor effectively prepare our students.

Today every country is scrambling to find its place in the “flattened world” popularly described by Thomas Friedman. “Every country thinks that it is behind. Innovation is often a synthesis of art and science and the best innovators often combine the two.” Every country is scurrying to upgrade its human talent base. John Hagel and John Brown remind us that “human talent is the only sustainable edge.” It is science and math interwoven with art, literature, music and the humanities, the integrated curriculum offered with expertise, professionalism and passion at UW-River Falls and our sister UW institutions, that best prepare students for international challenges yet unimagined. Investing in our people and their ability to create and to thrive in an integrated global environment will not only lead to productive and fulfilling lives, but also infuse our societies with citizens and leaders who understand opportunity and responsibility.

Our frame of reference will be global. Pierre Teihard de Chardin counseled a century ago when countries were king and no one could imagine otherwise that “The Age of Nations is passed; if we are not to perish, we must set aside our ancient prejudices, and build the earth.” From UW-River Falls’ continuing co-sponsorship of the Wisconsin in Scotland program and the International Traveling Classroom and Semester Abroad Europe to the numerous study tours offered by faculty, River Falls is assisting students in the essential process of developing an informed perspective, a global world view. Exciting possibilities with existing and new international institutional partners virtually on every continent will ensure that our students and faculty will continue to rediscover our world, and bring their new-found insight home, just as international students and faculty discover River Falls to be their home away from home.

We have an enduring and increasing commitment to our community, be it campus, town, state, country or world. We are stewards of this place and these precious resources—human, environmental, local and global. This reality and responsibility is evident to all of us as we embrace the beauty of River Falls, the Kinni, the St Croix Valley and our state. We must and will be an active partner in exploring, evaluating, and fostering sustainable development.

Prepare, mentor, challenge, inspire, collaborate, teach, inquire, debate, nurture people and curiosity, critique, create, applaud, serve, and to “model the way” among other duties. We are here to be cultivators of the economy through our institution and our graduates. We are the generators of economic development, and political, cultural, and social as well.

We are here to encourage our students and one another, and our communities and state, to aspire to greatness and to set the pathway to accomplish the goal. We are here to ensure an optimum quality of life by shaping citizens and leaders, communities and societies—one student, one class and one generation after another.

We are here to offer our students what, for centuries, persistent cultures and peoples implicitly have understood to be their inherited duty. We all learn it, each in our own way. I learned it from family, and in the verdant hills of eastern Oklahoma from the Cherokee Nation, and from the peoples of the Middle East and beyond, and from role models and mentors that enriched my life, some of whom are here in this arena.

These anchors and aspirations have value across time and cultures. They are our principles linked to possibilities, traditions and dreams. They connect an enduring sense of place, of community, of being home, with firm confidence in the quality of our students’ preparation, their education to power their growth and success. They intertwine their set of skills, insights and ethics, with their aspirations, opportunities and their responsibility to the community.

Our students are the living testimony to the efficacy and importance of public education. We believe in serving the public good as well as securing their private gain. Public service, civic engagement, service learning, inclusiveness, leadership development and global awareness have been and will be an integral part of their curriculum and this culture. Their experience here is a preview of life-long habits that will build social capital, create and sustain vibrant communities, and offer the antidote to Robert Putnam’s concern that we are “bowling alone,” namely, that we care for, and look after, only ourselves.

When we do this right, lives change, opportunities proliferate and society emerges vibrant and creative. And these values endure through time in many ways including via the achievements of our students.

In this way we will create the keys to our future, responding to the challenge of global change with confidence, pursuing excellence and creating and replenishing the reservoir of talented and engaged citizens ready and able to lead the St.Croix Valley and Wisconsin deep into the global century, a time when possibilities and problems will leap borders as distance and time continue to compress.

We are educating citizens and leaders—inspiring, mentoring and sculpting the next generation of researchers, entrepreneurs, civic leaders, diplomats, global thinkers and problem solvers, and good neighbors. We are creating the next Wisconsin and far beyond and are a vital ingredient in society’s promise to build a brighter future. We are here creating the roots and wings for the global century.

Fifty years from now very, very few, if any of us, will be here to ask the question: Who were those guys, those women and men who laid the bold, fresh foundations for the institution, the system and the state? Why did they ask those questions? Why did they make those decisions? What motivated them to plan and execute as they did?

We will inspire and educate citizens and leaders who, guided by our core values, will purposefully and ethically serve society. We will link our students and our communities to global opportunities and collaborative relationships in River Falls, the St. Croix Valley, in Wisconsin and beyond. We will be the life-long learning partner for all those who seek to discover their own potential and the richness and complexity of our multi-faceted world.

In this way we believe that we are deepening the roots and sprouting the wings of those who will surely follow us in this global century. In this way we follow and honor those who gave us our Roots and Wings.

Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life of our communities and developing the combination of knowledge, skills, values and motivation to make that difference.  It means promoting the quality of life in a community, through both political and non-political processes (Preface, pg. vi).

We strongly recommend using Version 4.0 or higher of either Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Communicator because our site works best with these browsers. Keep in mind that the newer browsers not only have newer features, they often fix browser vendor bugs, especially those dealing with Internet security.

To check in Internet Explorer 4.x, click View menu option at top of the browser. Select Internet Options, then select Advanced tab. Scroll down to Cookies section. Client must accept cookies for security, so check either "Prompt before accepting cookies" or "Always accept cookies." Click OK.

To check in Netscape Communicator 4.5, click Edit menu option at top of browser. Select Preferences. Under Categories, click on the word Advanced (not the + or - next to it). In the right side of the panel select the "Accept all cookies" or "Accept only cookies that get sent back to originating server." Click OK.

Firewalls can cause problems either completing the authentication process through our proxy server, or connecting to the databases.  If you have connection problems, disconnect your firewall to see if that helps.

Because our proxy server assigns a different port to each resource on a sort of random basis, opening a certain port can be tricky.  Start by allowing port 2048 - that should allow you to authenticate.

Select the Internet connection, Network Tasks, Change settings of this connection, Advanced tab, Internet Connection Firewall, uncheck or check the Protect my computer and network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet check box.

In Exceptions, scroll to the end of the list, then type a semi-colon (;) followed by just the host name of the EZproxy server (ezproxy.lib.lsu.edu). All the other sample entries have an asterisk (*) in front, and although it won't hurt, that isn't required for this entry. Do not include the port number.

Keep in mind that there are two new browser windows that will open when using FIND IT. The first is the list of services; this window also contains citation information from the source database. When you select one of the FIND IT services, a second new window opens with these results.

Full text is not always available electronically, either because the publisher doesn't make it available or because the library doesn't subscribe to it. In this case, you can check the catalog to see if the library has the item in print format. If the catalog search turns up "0 records" you may request the item from Interlibrary Loan by selecting the ILLiad service from the FIND IT menu.

FIND IT will get you as close to the article as it can, depending what the publisher provides. You may have to navigate through the publisher's site to get to the article you need. Remember that the citation information is available in the FIND IT menu window.

Archival collections can consist of hundreds of boxes worth of materials; always include specific information about the portion of the collection referred to including page, section, or date information, and if applicable, the filing unit (box/folder) in which the item is found. Ex)  Whitaker, Laurana Faustina Leavitt. Correspondence, 26 Aug. 1855. Box 1, Folder 5.

An important point to remember is that individual archival repositories often have different methods of organizing  records. Therefore, having a consistent rule for all archival citations is not necessarily feasible. If you are unsure about the structure of your citation, remember that its purpose is to guide the reader to the source; providing more information is always better than not enough. Never hesitate to ask the Archivist, a librarian or your professor for assistance.

Below is a sampling of the reference books available in the Chalmer Davee Library that discuss agriculture, horticulture and the environment. Other materials on these subjects can be found by searching the Voyager online catalog, or browsing the shelves near the titles listed below.
